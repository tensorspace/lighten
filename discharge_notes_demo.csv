Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you! You came to us with 
stomach pain and worsening distension. While you were here we 
did a paracentesis to remove 1.5L of fluid from your belly. We 
also placed you on you 40 mg of Lasix and 50 mg of Aldactone to 
help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we 
discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to 
make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high 
enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess 
fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. 
___ in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy 
and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. 
We wish you all the best!
Your ___ Team.

# Goals of care:  The patient expressed that her desire to ""let 
go"" and be at peace. She is tired of ""fighting"" her end stage 
liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of 
life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, 
which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would 
like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the 
patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably 
be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). 
Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also 
discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter 
placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged 
to home with hospice on ___.

# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient 
presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed 
with tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis 
on ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies 
on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant 
improvement in her pain.
 
# Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that 
she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. 
After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x 
2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been 
persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be 
monitored.

# Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3 
on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose 
in-house and at discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============

# Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic 
hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia 
related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis 
dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic 
through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 
10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she 
will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.

# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were 
continued in-house and at discharge.  

# COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued 
in-house and at discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture
[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)
[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have 
biweekly BMPs (script written). If K > 5.3, she should be given 
kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr. 
___.
[ ] Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement 
and code status.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You 
were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely 
that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from 
your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid 
was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to 
have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came 
down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as 
an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a 
representative from hospice. Because of your repeated 
paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex 
catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice 
coordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.

We wish you all the best!

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F w/ Hx of cervical CA s/p radical 
hysterectomy c/b chronic ___ lymphedema and urinary retention, 
Asthma, GERD, anxiety/depression, fibromyalgia. Please refer to 
the operative report for full details.

Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately 
post-op, her pain was controlled with IV dilaudid and toradol. 
However, in the PACU, the patient started feeling itchy.  Once 
the pt returned to the floor, she noted sensation of tongue / 
lip swelling, difficulty swallowing secretions, and a change in 
her voice.  No SOB, no flushing, no stridor or wheeze.  She was 
administered an Epi-pen, Solumedrol 100 mg IV, Famotidine 20 mg 
IV, and Hydroxyzine 25 mg IM.  She was transferred to the MICU 
for closer monitoring. 

The patient has numerous drug allergies and was administered the 
following medications intra-operatively: Midazolam, Rocuronium, 
Fentanyl, Dexamethasone, Hydromorphone, Ondansetron, Lidocaine, 
Propofol, Cefazolin, Glycopyrrolate, Phenylephrine, and 
Ketorolac.

In the MICU, initial VS were HR 87, BP 100/63, RR 17, S 100% 
___.  The patient was in NAD, without wheeze or poor air 
movement on exam, but complained of persistent voice change and 
difficulty swallowing, for which she required 2 more epi pens.  
Has remained hemodynamically stable and without respiratory 
compromise.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

*) Post operative care
Her pain was controlled immediately post-op with IV dilaudid and 
toradol. This was transitioned to po oxycodone as it was 
difficult to determine what was causing an allergic reaction in 
Ms. ___.

Her vaginal packing was removed on POD 1, on post-operative day 
2, her urine output was adequate and her Foley was removed. The 
patient was able to void spontaneously, but did require 
self-catheterization ___ times a day based on a sensation of 
bladder fullness. 

*) Anaphylaxis: 
In the PACU the patient awoke and started feeling pruritis. Once 
she arrived to the floor, the patient noted difficulty talking, 
subjectively swollen lips/tongue, and vocal changes. No SOB, no 
flushing, no stridor or wheeze. A trigger was called for 
anaphyllaxis and she recieved an Epi-pen, Solumedrol 100 mg IV, 
Famotidine 20 mg IV, and Hydroxyzine 25 mg IM.  She was 
transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. 

In the MICU, initial VS were HR 87, BP 100/63, RR 17, S 100% 
___.  The patient was in NAD, without wheeze or poor air 
movement on exam, but complained of persistent voice change and 
difficulty swallowing, for which she required 2 more epi pens.  
Has remained hemodynamically stable and without respiratory 
compromise. 

Of note, patient was lying comfortable in bed around 2200 and 
continuing to inquire about more Epi-pens vs epinephrine gtt 
despite comfortable respiration, vocalization, non-edematous 
oral structures. She also perseverated about her Ativan and 
Ambien, as well as her propranolol for essential tremor despite 
explanation that beta blockers can worsen bronchoconstriction 
and respiratory compromise in anaphylaxis.

On the day she was called out to the floor, the pt complained of 
persistent facial flushing.  She was afebrile, hemodynamically 
stable, and without respiratory compromise or systemic symptoms. 
 Symptomatic care with hydroxyzine and eucerin lotion was 
provided.

Upon step down to the floor, the patient again reported to 
nursing that she felt throat constriction. Epinephrine and 
solumedrol were given and the patient felt relief. Allergy was 
consulted, and they asked us to stop all new medications given 
to her while at the hospital, and to report all of them as 
allergies. In addition, we sent out a tryptase level, as well as 
coordinated outpatient follow-up with them. 

#Chronic ___ edema: Continue home Metolazone, spironolactone, 
potassium repletion as not hypotensive.  We monitored her K 
during her stay, which was WNL.

#Asthma: Home Albuterol use ___ per week, did not require in 
the MICU. 

#GERD: Nexium (was initially held on admission, but per pt 
request was given on ___ prior to advancing diet)

#ADHD: On Adderall, held on admission

# Anxiety/depression/fibromyalgia: lorazepam 

# Insomnia: zolpidem

By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was the  discharged home in stable condition 
with outpatient follow-up scheduled. She was also scheduled to 
have an appointment with Allergy and Immunology.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a pleasant ___ w/ a h/o aortic regurgitation, 
hypothyroidism, Sjogrens, and HTN who presents as a transfer 
from ___ after a syncopal episode on ___ AM. Upon admission, 
she was hemodynamically stable, but was found to have 
asymptomatic pyuria, cough, and a WBC of 12.0.
.

.
#Syncope: Pt's syncopal episode appears to be c/w vasovagal 
syncope, likely in the setting of her asymptomatic pyuria. She 
also had a ___ in which her Tn's were negative X2 and EKG's 
were c/w and unchanged from previous. She was hemodynamically 
stable and received fluids and bactrim (see below). Given her 
h/o aortic regurgitation, an Echo was ordered but will be 
obtained by the pt on an outpatient basis.
.
#Pyuria: She had 18 WBC and Lg leuk esterase on UA on admission, 
although she had no bacteria on UA or Sx of burning/dysuria. 
Given her syncopal episode in the setting of a UTI, treatment 
with bactrim was started in the ED and continued for a total of 
4 days.
.
#Leukocytosis: Her WBC of 12.0 is likely in the setting of her 
UTI. She was treated with PO bactrim as above. 
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#Anemia: Hct ___ is 32.6, slightly down from baseline of ~35. 
Her Iron studies, B12, and Folate were within normal limits.
.
#HTN: Her home lisinopril was decreased to 10mg PO qday, in the 
setting of her syncope in order to ensure her BP does not drop 
too low.
.
#Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure providing care for you here at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted after having a syncopal 
(fainting) episode on ___.  You were found to have some 
evidence of a urinary tract infection and were treated with an 
antibiotic called Bactrim.  Your chest x-ray at the other 
hospital did not show evidence of a pneumonia.  We monitored 
your heart rhythm overnight and did not note any abnormalities.  
Your electrocardiogram did not show any changes.  Your blood 
pressure remained stable.  You will need an ultrasound of the 
heart for further evaluation (echocardiogram), but this can be 
done after you leave the ___. 

Your condition has improved and you can be discharged to home.

The following changes were made to your medications:

NEW: 
-Bactrim double-strength tab, 1 tab by mouth twice daily for 2 
more days (to treat urinary tract infection)

CHANGED:
- DECREASED Lisinopril to 10mg by mouth daily

Please keep your follow-up appointments as scheduled below.  We 
are also working to schedule your echocardiogram.

Of note, while you were here you had a video swallow study that 
did not show evidence that you are aspirating when you swallow.  
You can continue to eat a regular diet.

Legionella Urinary Antigen (___): NEG FOR LEGIONELLA 
SEROGROUP 1 AG   

Urine Culture: negative or yeast in multiple cultures

Blood Cultures: NGTD or negative in multiple cultures

Imaging:
CT Abd/Plevis with Contrast (___):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffuse colonic mucosal hyperenhancement and bowel wall 
thickening is
consistent with pancolitis.
2.  Ground-glass opacities within the right middle and right 
lower lobes
compatible with acute infection and/or aspiration.  Possible 
mild pulmonary
edema.
3.  Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and prominence of the 
common bile and pancreatic ducts could be better characterized 
with non-emergent MRCP.

CXR (___):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Bibasilar opacities would be consistent with pneumonia 
and/or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  Likely some 
component of pulmonary edema given the interstitial thickening.
2.  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel may represent ileus or 
obstruction. Dedicated abdominal radiograph may be performed for 
better characterization.

ECHO (___):
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Left ventricular 
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild 
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular 
calcification. There is moderate functional mitral stenosis 
(mean gradient XXmmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild 
to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
mitral regurgitation is now less prominent. The mitral inflow 
gradient is similar (although not reported in the previous 
report). 

AXR (___):
There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.  There are multiple 
distended loops of bowel, most likely representing both colon 
and small bowel.  Findings are most consistent with an ileus.  
Air-fluid levels are seen on the left lateral decubitus view.
IMPRESSION:  Dilated colon and small bowel consistent with 
ileus.

Head CT (___): IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.

ECHO (___):
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is 
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. There is mild aortic valve stenosis 
(valve area 1.6 cm2). Due to the technically suboptimal nature 
of this study, LVOT obstruction cannot be excluded with 
certainty. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There 
is severe mitral annular calcification (cannot exclude posterior 
leaflet MVP). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due 
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may 
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

Repeat CT Abd/Pelvis (___):
IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, 
and in 
abdominal ascites.  The colon remains dilated and ahaustral, in 
keeping with C. difficile colitis. 

CXR (___):
There is a Dobbhoff tube whose distal tip is in the body of the 
stomach.  
There are bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a right-sided 
pleural-based catheter.  There is no pneumothoraces or signs for 
overt pulmonary edema.  Overall, these findings are stable since 
prior study from ___. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an ___ year-old woman with history of Sjogren's syndrome 
and IBS presenting with fevers, diarrhea, tachycardia, 
hypotension, leukocytosis, hypoxia, found to have pancolitis and 
pneumonia.

# Septic Shock due to Cdiff Colitis: On admission meet criteria 
for sepsis given fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis and likely 
source being colitis. BP remained low and patient remained 
mildly tachycardic for next ___ requiring aggressive IVF 
(roughly 20L in first 72hrs). Initially started on IV flagyl/PO 
vanco emperically for possible Cdiff as well as levofloxacin 
over concern for PNA. Bcx, Ucx unrevealing. Stool for Cdiff 
ultimately positive and levofloxacin changed to CTX/Azithro. PCP 
(Dr. ___ visited and said that pt always has CXR infiltrate 
so abx for CTX/Azithro for pneumonia stopped after pt had 
received total of 3 days PNA treatment. Lactate and WBC count 
trended up in first 48hrs and patient developed ileus on 
abdominal imaging with worsening distension. GI and Gen Surg 
followed and pt kept NPO initially, but ultimately illness 
turned around with just Abx and IVF. By time of ICU call-out, BP 
had stabilized without requiring fluids and abdominal exam was 
improving with downtrending WBC. Came back to ICU on ___ due to 
respiratory distress and hypoxia. Also had to be started back on 
pressors, initially phenylephrine but then this was stopped as 
extremities were cold and mottled. Pressors changed to 
Norepinephrine and mottling of ext quickly resolved. SVO2 and 
ECHO not consistent with cardiogenic shock and EKG/Trops were 
negative. ID saw in consult and recommended starting Tigecycline 
to help cover Cdiff which she completed an 8 day course of. 
Abdominal exam improved and ileus resolved. Doboff was placed on 
___ and tube feeds were started due poor ability to keep with 
with nutritional requirements. Metronidazole d/c'd on ___. Plan 
to continue Vancomycin 500mg PO Q6 for a total of 2 weeks after 
all other antibiotics were stopped (last day ___.

# Hypoxia: No breathing issues at baseline but developed hypoxia 
requiring 5L NC while in ED so was admitted to the ICU. Initial 
concern for RLL PNA on CXR and received 3 days of Abx as noted 
above until PCP informed MICU team that infiltrate had been 
present for some time. Thought that hypoxia developed in setting 
of aggressive fluids in patient with significant mitral regurg 
(got 4L in ED and then aggressive IVF in first 72hrs) and the 
development of pleural effusions. Had started diuresis by MICU 
callout on ___ but then after couple days on floor, triggered 
for hypoxia and increased work of breathing on ___. Found to 
have significant worsening of R pleural effusion and development 
of L pleural effusion. Required intubation for respiratory state 
on ___. Cardiac w/u showed no cardiogenic component and when 
spiked fever on ___ started on empiric HCAP coverage after 
mini-BAL was performed. Interventional pulmonary (IP) consulted 
on ___ and performed right sided thoracentesis with pigtail 
placement. ID saw on ___ and recommended stopping 
Vanco/cefepime as unclear if actual pneumonia and starting 
Tigecycline as would cover many HCAP organisms and also treat 
Cdiff. Mini-BAL and pleural fluid with negative cultures. 
Started diuresis again on ___ as she was weaned off pressors 
and extubated. She was weaned off all oxygen at the time of 
discharge and right pigtail still draining 400-700cc per day, 
will follow-up with IP after discharge.  She will require 
ongoing diuresis given her significant volume overload, she 
responds well to ___ IV Lasix and had been ___ negative 
in the days leading up to discharge.

# Altered Mental Status: 
In setting of trigger for hypoxia and MICU transfer on ___, 
there was concern that she was less responsive with concern for 
focal defecits. Stat head CT without evidence of stroke or 
bleed. Neuro was consulted and said nothing to do and deficits 
resolved over next ___. EEG initially ordered but then 
canceled after discussion with neuro. Rest of ICU stay had 
intermittent delerium in the evenings requiring some doses of 
Olanzapine. Delerium had improved by time of ICU callout but 
still with some sundowning.

# Hyponatremia: Patient with Na of 127 in ED. Likely hypovolemic 
hyponatremia in setting of diarrhea/poor PO intake. Could also 
be SIADH given pneumonia, pain. Upon review of old labs, patient 
often hyponatremic as outpatient as well. Urine lytes confusing 
in setting of shock as urine Na elevated in ___ so some question 
of sodium wasting renal injury. Hyponatremia started to resolve 
as overall condition improved and did not re-develop even in 
setting of ___ ICU readmission for hypoxia.

# ___: Patient with creatinine of 1.1 at admission up from 
recent baseline of 0.7 - 0.8. Likely pre-renal etiology in 
setting of infection, diarrhea, poor PO intake. Trended up 
slightly to 1.3 after a few days likely with mild ATN in setting 
of persistent boarderline hypotension. Lisinopril was held while 
in ICU for this and hypotension. Cr trended back down to roughly 
0.5 and stayed there for rest of hospitalization even in setting 
of second ICU readmission.

--Inactive issues--

# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

# Hypertension: Due to hypotension with sepsis, lisinopril was 
held.  BP remained well controlled and this will continue to be 
held at discharge.

# GERD: Omeprazole stopped when Cdiff came back positive. For 
time was put on H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis but this stopped 
again when delerious and started feeeding.

# Code: Full (confirmed with patient, son-in-law)

# Transitional issues
-Right pigtail pleural catheter in place at discharge, she will 
follow-up with interventional pulmonary after discharge. Tube 
can be removed when output is <200cc per day.
-Will need ongoing diuresis given large volume of fluids she 
received in the ICU this admission, she responds well to Lasix 
10mg IV. Goal ___ negative as BP tolerates.
-Will continue on high dose PO vancomycin through ___ (___fter other abx stopped)
-She should continue tube feeds until taking adequate PO, would 
benefit from ongoing nutrition evaluation

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman, recently hospitalized for C. Difficile sepsis 
and shock, re-admitted to ___ from ___ with altered 
mental status, tachypnea and a mild respiratory acidosis.

#Hypoxia/hypercarbia: She initially required BiPAP and was 
admitted to the MICU for monitoring of her respiratory status.  
She was able to be weaned from BiPAP on ICU day 2 and remained 
on 2L NC at the time of discharge.  Cause of her respiratory 
symptoms is unclear, but may be due to hypoventilation from 
somnolence related to oversedation with Zyprexa.  Zyprexa was 
held at the time of discharge.  CTA Chest was negative for PE 
and showed no clear evidence of pneumonia.  She was initially 
started on HCAP antibiotics with vanc/cefepime which were 
stopped on HD 4 prior to discharge given that all cultures were 
negative and there was no consolidation on imaging. 

# Delirium: Likely multifactorial, but thought to be related to 
oversedation from Zyprexa.  There was no evidence of infection 
and antibiotics were quickly stopped as described above.  UA was 
dirty, but UCx was negative x2 (grew only yeast) and she had no 
urinary symptoms.  Most of her mental status changes were 
probably related to her sedationg medications and hypercarbia at 
admission, which improved with BiPAP and holding her 
antipsychotics.

# C Diff Colitis: Recently admitted for C. diff colitis with 
sepsis. Repeat C Diff PCR was negative during this 
hospitalization. She continued to have high volume stool output 
and Flexiseal is in place for skin ulceration.  ID was curbsided 
regarding vanco course given that she received a few days of 
HCAP antibotics and her PO vanco was changed to 125mg q6h for 7 
days after stopping IV vanc/cefepime (D7 will be ___.  
Flexiseal in place at discharge.

# Anemia: Patient with guaiac positive stools this admission, 
new from past admission.  Felt to be secondary to sloughing and 
mucosal oozing secondary to C diff. Normal lactate on admission 
and benign abdominal exam.  Hct has been variable recently, but 
fairly stable, although still markedly below her baseline of low 
to mid ___.

# Bilateral pleural effusions: Noted to have bilateral pleural 
effusions last hospitalization in setting of massive fluid 
resuscitation, right pleural pigtail catheter removed this 
admission in the MICU. She is still volume overloaded on exam, 
but her bicarb remained elevated, and she was not given any 
further diuresis.  The elevated bicarb is also be partially due 
to compensation from her respiratory acidosis.

# Volume overload: She has some diastolic dysfunction and has 2+ 
MR on ___. She continues to appear total body overloaded, likely 
in setting of volume resuscitation on prior admission for 
sepsis, but with contraction alkalosis currently, so further 
diuresis was held as above.  Consider further diuresis once 
hypercarbia improves and bicarb trends down.  

# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily 
 
# Hypertension: Patient was previously on lisinopril which was 
held since last admission in setting of sepsis and relative 
hypotension.  She remained normotensive

# GERD: Patient previously on omeprazole last hospitalization, 
which was stopped after C. diff came back positive, and she was 
transitioned to H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis but this was 
stopped again when she became delirious last hospitalization.  
She remains off H2 blocker at discharge because of concern that 
it may be contributing to her AMS.

# Code status this admission: FULL

# Transitional issues:
-Foley was removed ___ and she has not voided as of discharge, 
may need Foley replaced if she is unable to void
-Would restart diuresis when bicarb trends down
-Continue PO vanco 125mg q6h through ___
-Please follow Hct daily given melanotic stools, should resolve 
as her C. diff resolves
-Midline removed ___
-Pigtail catheter removed this admission
-F/u pending BCx, catheter tip cx

Recommend 
repositioning. 
3. NG tube terminates ___ stomach with sidehole ___ distal 
esophagus. 
3. Right PICC terminates ___ the axilla. 

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST (___): There is no evidence of 
hemorrhage, edema, infarction, or mass effect. The ventricles 
and sulci are prominent, suggesting age-related involutional 
changes or atrophy. Periventricular white matter hypodensities 
are compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Basal 
cisterns appear patent, and there is preservation of gray-white 
matter differentiation. No fracture is identified. There is 
fluid within the nasal cavity, likely secondary to intubated 
state.  Atherosclerotic mural calcifications of the internal 
carotid arteries are present. The visualized paranasal sinuses, 
mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are otherwise clear. 
Bilateral ocular lenses have been replaced. IMPRESSION: No 
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. 

TTE (___): The left atrium is normal ___ size. There is mild 
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The 
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular 
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study dated ___ (images reviewed), 
findings are similar.  

AP UPRIGHT CHEST X-RAY (___): Compared to the most recent 
study, there is improvement ___ the mild pulmonary edema and 
decrease ___ the small left pleural effusion. Moderate right 
pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis are stable. 

AP UPRIGHT CHEST X-RAY (___): Cardiac size is normal. Lines 
and tubes are ___ the standard position. Large right and moderate 
left pleural effusions are grossly unchanged allowing the 
differences ___ positioning of the patient. Right upper lobe 
opacity has improved consistent with improving atelectasis. 
Pleural effusions are associated with atelectasis, larger on the 
right side. There is mild vascular congestion. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is an ___ year old woman, recently hospitalized for C. 
Difficile sepsis and shock, complicated by readmission 
hypoxia/hypercarbia (___) p/w hypercarbic respiratory 
failure and urinary tract infection. 
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Etiology likely 
multifactorial, primarily respiratory muscle weakness and pulm 
edema with pleural effusions as noted on admission x-ray (has 
history of 2+ mitral regurg). She remained intubated for most of 
her MICU stay due to pulmonary edema and respiratory muscle 
weakness with a poor negative inspiratory force (NIF). Her NIF 
gradually improved with optimization of her nutrition and 
supportive care. Her pulmonary edema was addressed with 
aggressive diuresis with IV and PO Lasix boluses (responds well 
to Lasix 10mg IV). With treatment of these issues, she was able 
to be successfully extubated to nasal cannula on ___. She 
was started on Lisinopril 5mg daily for afterload reduction ___ 
setting of her 2+ MR which may have been causing the pulmonary 
edema. She may require further PRN doses of Lasix at rehab; if 
so would try Lasix 20mg PO PRN. Consider increasing lisinopril 
to 10mg for better afterload reduction pressure tolerating.
.
# Pseudomonas UTI: Patient grew out Pseudomonas sensitive to 
everything but Gentamicin on ___ urine culture. She was

with bright red blood per rectum thought to be acute lower GI 
bleed, subsequently stabilizing without intervention, status 
post flexible sigmoidoscopy without identifiable source, 
remaining stable x greater than 4 days, able to be discharged to 
rehab facility.

# Acute GI Bleed NOS - Patient presented with acute episode of 
BRBPR concerning for lower GI source.  Patient subsequently 
monitored without new or worsening anemia.  After discussion 
with family and patient regarding whether or not to further 
workup, they opted for flexible sigmoidoscopy (felt colonoscopy 
might be too invasive).  Patient underwent aborted flexible 
sigmoidoscopy on ___ due to pressence of copious stool in 
rectal vault, and then underwent successful flexible 
sigmoidoscopy on ___ without identifiable source for her 
bleeding.  From admission Hgb 9.8, discharge hemoglobin was 
10.5.  Per GI, could consider outpatient colonoscopy if 
consistent with patient's wishes.  

# Osteoporosis / chronic L1 compression fracture / 
deconditioning - patient with recent L1 compression fracture as 
outpatient prior to admission; patient noted to be significantly 
deconditioned this admission, requiring assistance with ADLs; 
patient seen by ___ and recommended for rehab.  Continued home 
Calcium 500 + vitamin D, calcitonin.  Placed on Tylenol and 
tramadol for pain control with good effect 

# Chronic Severe Protein Calorie Malnutrition - per discussion 
with family and review of chart, patient has lost weight despite 
PEG placement and bolus tube feeds (has had difficulty 
maintaining PO intake due to her Sjogrens).  At home patient has 
not be using full recommended 2 cans of Nutren 2.0, 500 
Cal/250ml BID.  Here patient seen by nutrition, continued on 
above 2 cans, and was given oral supplementation with her PO 
meals as well.   

# Depression - continued home BuPROPion and mirtazapine 

# Hypothryoidism - continued levothyroxine 

Transitional Issues
- Code status - DNR/DNI
- Discharged to rehab
- No source for bleeding identified this admission; can consider 
future colonoscopy to look for source of bleeding, but would 
first discuss if consistent with patient's goals of care
- Would consider encouragement of PO intake and PEG-tube 
supplementation given her malnutrition

Relevant Imaging:
-----------------
TTE ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and 
cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= ? 35-40% - assessment 
limited by suboptimal image quality and significant beat to beat 
variability). There is hypokinesis of the mid-distal LV segments 
and apex. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial 
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior focused study (images reviewed) of 
___, left ventricular systolic function is probably 
similar, although suboptimal image quality of both studies 
precludes definite comparison.  

___ CXR
 
IMPRESSION:  
  
Generalized improvement in both lungs is probably due to 
decrease in pulmonary 
edema, now mild, and decrease in previous moderate right pleural 
effusion.  
There is still substantial consolidation in the right upper lobe 
probably 
pneumonia but the bilateral lower lobe components have improved. 
 Heart size 
top-normal.  No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M w/ HTN, HLD, DMII, and old MI transferred 
from ___ w/ NSTEMI w/ diffuse 3 vessel disease s/p DES to 
mid-LAD occlusion found to have severe Cdiff.

ACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# NSTEMI 
NSTEMI based on STE aVR and V1 but o/w ST depressions w/ 
significant multi vessel disease but significant stenosis in LAD 
s/p DES that occluded diagnonal. Repeat cath unchanged. He was 
started on plavix, atorvastatin, ACE-I, and metoprolol. Echo 
showed LVEF 35-40% with hypokinesis of mid-distal LV segments 
and apex. He was started on warfarin for his hypokinetic LV as 
well as his atrial fibrillation as discussed below.

# ___
Possibly mixed cardiogenic/distributive given mixed venous O2 
65%, CI 2.1, PCWP 25. He initially required pressors and balloon 
pump and was then successfully weaned off both. He remained 
hemodynamically stable during rest of hospital course. 

# Atrial Fibrillation
Patient with a reported history of paroxysmal afib per his PCP 
for which he was maintained on digoxin as well as aspirin 325mg 
PO daily prior to admission.  He was found to be in atrial 
fibrillation during admission and the decision was made to 
anticoagulate with Coumadin.  He was continued on home dose 
digoxin.  His home dose aspirin was decreased as discussed above 
with initiation of Coumadin.

# Hematuria: 
Likely traumatic in setting of systemic anticoagulation, as 
patient pulled at ___. Cytology was negative. He will followup 
outpatient with urology.

# Dyspnea: 
Patient had acute episodes of dyspnea.  This was mainly 
attributed to pulmonary edema and improved with diruesis.  
Additionally, CXR showed possible consolidation of RUL, 
concerning for aspiration pneumonia. However, treatment was 
deferred as he had no other focal signs of infectious pna.  He 
did have sputum cultures which grew Klebsiella pneumonia but on 
discussion with ID, felt this did not warrant any treatment as 
he was asymptomatic.  He was discharged on po lasix 20 mg daily 
with next electrolytes to be checked ___. 
 
# C diff, severe: 
Had loose stool in setting of antibiotic tx for Hpylori 
(initiated outpatient). Given WBC >15, ___, age >___ treated as 
severe. Patient was started on vancomycin 125mg PO qid for 14 
day course (day ___, last day ___. 
 
# GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD): 
Endoscopy confirmed H Pylori treated with PPI + 
clarithromycin/amoxicillin since ___ for 14 days. Omeprazole 
was continued. Antibiotics held in setting of c.diff infection. 

# Delirium: 
Patient with frequent sundowning during hospitalization 
requiring Seroquel po.

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# Spinal Stenosis: Continued gabapentin, d/ced naproxen.  Did 
not complain of pain throughout hospital course.  Explained he 
should not take any more NSAIDS in setting of recent ACS and now 
on Coumadin, Plavix and asa. 
# DM: maintained on ISS during admission and discharged on home 
glipizide and metformin
# HTN: Home dose metoprolol uptitrated.  Home dose lisinopril 
decreased.  Home dose imdur discontinued.
# HLD: Transitioned home dose simvastatin to atorvastatin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
- Discharge weight: 63.7kg 
- patient will require urology followup given hematuria during 
admission.  Urine cytology negative.
- patient will need to be treated for hpylori once he completes 
a course of PO Vancomycin for Severe CDiff
- Please check electrolytes on ___ on lasix
- Coumadin initiated given atrial fibrillation, ASA decreased 
from 325 mg to 81 mg daily
- Started on Plavix given recent stent placement, atorvastatin 
80 mg (stopped simvastatin), and Lasix 20 mg po daily
- Home metoprolol was increased from 25 mg XL to 50 mg XL daily, 
lisinopril decreased to 2.5 mg po daily and home imdur was 
discontinued
- patient will need to continue a 14 day course of PO Vanc (day 
___- ___ last day ___ for cdiff infection
- Patient instructed to not take any NSAIDS
- SLP treatment at rehab for pharyngeal strengthening exercises

self-presents after calling 911. Patient is known to be an
inconsistent historian, and on this interview frequently 
appeared
to just be agreeing with whatever this writer said, often
contradicting herself. On interview she now states she called

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o ___ homeless F with PMHx of TBI, HIV+, HCV, 
polysubstance abuse (alcohol, crack cocaine, and heroin), 
unspecified mood disorder (MDD with psychotic features vs. 
substance-induced mood disorder), and chronic AH who presented 
from ___ station via EMS with complaint of multiple head strikes 
found to have EtOH intoxication and SI admitted to MICU for EtOH 
withdrawal and CIWA monitoring, now stabilized and transferred 
to the floor, now medically stable for discharge to psychiatric 
facility

ACTIVE ISSUES:
========================
# EtOH intoxication/withdrawal: on phenobarbital withdrawal 
protocol.  Last drink ___.  Patient was loaded with 
phenobarbital, which may continue if the accepting psychiatric 
facility is okay with administering, however there is no 
contraindication to discontinuing.
-Phenobarb protocol while inpatient, stopped at discharge
-Continued MVI, thiamine, folate
-Hydroxyzine PRN for additional agitation
-seen by psychiatry and social work - appreciated.

# Suicidal ideation: patient repeatedly stating ""I have suicidal 
thoughts"" and ""I'm depressed,"" though is unable to fully 
elaborate. Psychiatry saw the patient and had the following 
recommendations: -Patient meets ___ criteria for 
involuntary admission, may not leave AMA, should continue 1:1 
observation.
-Would hold on any psychiatric medications given acute alcohol 
withdrawal.
-If chemical restraint necessary, please call psychiatry for 
specific recs. Please be aware that patient has cited ""jaw 
locking"" with Haldol administration in the past, thus would 
consider alternative antipsychotic.
- seen by psychiatry - recommended inpatient psychiatric 
placement, and transferred to deac 4.

# FEVER: Patient febrile to 101 in the ED. No localizing signs 
of symptoms of infection. Suspect that this was likely related 
to acute ingestion, however given her murmur which has not been

and not necessarily alcoholic hallucinosis.  Will defer to 
psychiatry.

presents to ___ ED with BRBPR found to have newly diagnosed 
anal adenocarcinoma.

# Anal adenocarcinoma: Patient initially presented with a 
history of changes in bowel habits and some bright red blood per 
rectum. Initial concern was for anal fissure, but after being 
seen by GI, they recommended evaluation by Colon and Rectal 
Surgery. They agreed that her lesion was concerning for 
malignancy, so she underwent EUS/biopsy with colorectal surgery 
___, which revealed lesion concerning for anal squamous cell 
caricnoma. Baseline CEA 20. Staging scans showed local disease 
without suspicious regional LAD, and no distant mets. She also 
underwent colonoscopy which showed no evidence of disease beyond 
the known anal/rectal lesion.

# Anal/rectal pain: Patient's pain was controlled initially with 
tylenol and dilaudid, then transitioned to tylenol and 
oxycodone. She was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen to keep 
her bowel movements soft so as not to cause additional pain. Her 
bowel regimen included docusate, colace and miralax, as well as 
being advised to increase and regulate her fiber intake. She was 
also given nitroglycerin 0.02% cream, 2% lidocaine ointment, 
Tuck's ointment and perineum care recommendations from wound 
care nursing.

# Pancytopenia: Patient with downtrending thrombocytopenia, also 
with neutropenia and stable anemia noted on admission. She was 
midly neutropenic. This was thought to be a combination of 
lenalidomide effect combined with anemia of chronic disease. No 
bony metastases were seen on initial cancer staging to implicate 
bone marrow spread. Heme/Onc consult from ___ recommended that 
this be followed as an outpatient but did not require inpatient 
work-up.

# IgG Myeloma: Patient with longstanding IgG MM, followed by 
___ Oncology for which she is on lenolidamide days ___ of 28 
days and dexamethasone 1x/week on weeks when she takes 
lenolidamide. The patient completed her last 3 weeks of Revlamid 
___. Also received Zometa ___. 
Lenolidamide/dexamethasone was held while patient was admitted 
due to risk of poor wound healing from biopsy. She was seen by 
Heme/Onc Consult from ___ who recommended following her 
pancytopenia and following up with her oncologist, Dr. ___ 
___ as an outpatient.

# Asymptomatic bacteruria: Patient has a history of chronic 
Klebsiella bacteriuria as a complication of UPJ obstruction s/p 
stent placement in ___. Patient was asymptopmatic from this 
during her hospitalization. She was monitored for active 
symptoms of UTI. 

# AFib on coumadin: Stable during admission. Did require 
adminsitration of FFP before biopsy and colonoscopy with FFP. 
Otherwise, was continued on home metoprolol, diliazem and 
warfarin. 

# Hypertension: Was relatively hypotensive initially, which 
prompted the team to hold lasix. Near the end of her hosptial 
course, she began to endorse some leg swelling, so we restarted 
furosemide ___. She was continued on diltiazem and 
metoprolol for the duration of her hospital stay as per above.

# CKD Stage 3: Cr 1.2 on admission, within recent baseline of 
1.4. Down to 0.9 at discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient is not being discharged on Bactrim since she is not 
currently taking dexamethasone.
- Patient should follow-up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient who can 
then refer to Dr. ___ Colon & Rectal Surgery 
Multidisciplinary follow-up.
- Continue bowel regimen to prevent constipation and subsequent 
painful bowel movements

STUDIES:
--------
___ CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMHx obesity, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CKD III 
(baseline 1.4) and chronic multiple myeloma and adenocarcinoma 
of anal canal (dx'ed ___ presenting for AFib with RVR.

ACUTE ISSUES:
-------------
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Pt presented initially with RVR 
in the 140s. Most likely in the setting of B-blocker and CCB 
being held due to hypotension. C. diff infection (see below) 
most likely contributing to hypotension. Pt received IV 
metoprolol and IV diltiazem in ED and was started on PO 
metoprolol/diltiazem on floor. She was also fluid resuscitated. 
Patient discharged with control of afib with RVR with PO metop 
and diltiazem at home doses. INR was supratherapeutic and 
coumadin was held (see below). 

# Hypotension: Per nursing home, she had intermittent 
hypotension requiring  discontinuation of her metoprolol and 
diltiazem. Most likely secondary to decreased PO intake/loose 
stools from C.diff infection. Adrenal insufficiency secondary to 
chronic steroid use in the setting of infection was ruled out 
with AM cortisol (30). 

# Funguria, bacteruria: Pt initially reported dysuria and UA x2 
showed large leuks/bacteria/yeast. Despite being contaminated, 
due to symptoms of dysuria, she was initially treated with IV 
CTX. Urine cultures eventually grew only yeast, prompting 
discontinuation of CTX. She was no longer symptomatic at this 
time, and she had no CVA tenderness or systemic symptoms of 
infection. She had a foley place initially for urine output 
monitoring, however, this was removed. Funguria will be treated 
with fluconazole for total 7 days of therapy. 

# C.difficile infection: Although no recent history of 
antibiotics, patient immunosuppressed and at rehabilitation 
facility. She was initially started on PO metronidazole on 
___, but this was changed to PO vanc, given that she is 
immunosuppresed and falls into the severe category. ___, 
___.

# Coagulopathy: INR on admission was 6.5. Most likely secondary 
to decreased PO ntake and exacerbated antibiotics. No active 
signs of bleeding. Once INR reached 7.8, she was given 2.5 mg PO 
vitamin K. She received additional 2.5 mg PO vitamin K on 
___. Coumadin was held on discharge.  

# Acute on chronic CKD (stage 3): Cr 1.2 (baseline 0.8-1.1). 
Most likely secondary to decreased PO intake and decreased 
cardiac output from afib with RVR. Creatinine improved with IVF.

# Lower extremity edema: Multi-factorial. Most likely venous 
stasis vs diastolic heart failure, especially in the setting of 
afib with RVR, vs hypoalbuminemia. Pa/lateral film in ED showed 
no cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascualar congestion to suggest 
decompensated systolic heart failure. Pt on furosemide at home. 
Albumin was 3.0. Furosemide held on admission due to ___. Edema 
was managed with pneumatic boots. Furosemide was restarted at 40 
mg on discharge. 

# UPJ obstruction s/p stent placement ___ c/b persistent 
Klebsiella bacteruria: Pt scheduled for stent replacement soon. 
She had no CVA tenderness on exam and creatinine was stable 
after IVF. Pt was scheduled to have stent replaced on ___, 
but procedure was cancelled due to supratherapeutic INR. Per 
Urology, pt's INR needs to be <3.0 and she will need this 
procedure in the next ___ months. 

# Troponinemia: Most likely strain from RVR vs decreased 
clearance in the setting of ___. Peaked at 0.02 before 
downtrending.

# Hyperlactatemia: Lactate 2.6 on admission. Most likely 
secondary to dehydration versus ineffective cardiac output from 
RVR. Peaked at 2.6 before downtrending.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
---------------
# Weakness: She had generalized total body weakness, with the 
lower extremities worse than upper extremities. Also with the 
left ___ greater than right ___. No documented previous CVA 
to which asymmetry can be attributed. Most likely deconditioning 
and myopathy from dexamethasone, versus myositis or 
cerebrovascular event, both thought unlikely. CK was within 
normal limits. ___ worked with patient and she was discharged 
back to rehab.

# Leg pain: Most likely osteoarthritis. She does not have 
diabetes to suggest neuropathy. She continued home oxycodone 10 
mg qHS.

# Pancytopenia: Patient with stable neutropenia, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia improved from prior, thought to be secondary to 
lenalidomide as well as anemia of chronic disease.

# Anal adenocarcinoma: Diagnosed recently in ___. T2N0M0. 
Staging scans showed local disease without suspicious regional 
LAD, and no distant mets. Baseline CEA 20. Has plans for 
colorectal surgeon Dr. ___ diverting ostomy. S/p port 
placement in ___. Plans for chemo/radiation. Updated 
oncologist.

# Anorectal pain: Her bowel regimen included docusate, colace 
and miralax, as well as being advised to increase and regulate 
her fiber intake. She was also given nitroglycerin 0.02% cream, 
2% lidocaine ointment, Tuck's ointment and perineum care 
recommendations from wound care nursing. Bowel regimen was held 
in the setting of loose stools. 

# IgG myeloma: Patient with longstanding IgG MM, followed by 
___ Oncology for which she is on lenolidamide days ___ of 28 
days and dexamethasone 1x/week on weeks when she takes 
lenolidamide. The patient completed her last 3 weeks of Revlamid 
___. Also received Zometa ___. 
Lenolidamide/dexamethasone was held during admission due to 
infection. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
--------------------
- C.diff infection, Severe: Needs PO vancomycin 125mg PO QID 
until ___ for total 14 day treatment course.
- Funguria: Three urine cultures grew >100,000 cfu/ml of yeast. 
She was started on fluconazole treatment, per her Urologist. D1 
= ___, D7 = ___.
- Ureteral stent replacement: Was scheduled for replacement on 
___, but cancelled due to supratherapeutic INR. Her stent 
can be replaced when her INR is therapeutic (2.0 - 3.0). When 
therapeutic, please call her Urologist Dr. ___ to schedule a 
stent replacement. She will also see him on ___.
- Supratherapeutic INR: Will need daily INR checks to follow INR 
until therapeutic so Coumadin may be restarted. If uptrending 
x72hours, consider 2.5mg PO vitamin K (in the absence of normal 
gut flora due to C. diff infection).
- Diastolic heart failure: Patient restarted on lower dose of 
furosemide 40 mg. Uptitrate as necessary based on volume status 
and kidney function.
- Myeloma: Revlamid/dexamethasone held during admission and on 
discharge. Please call her Oncologist Dr. ___ to discuss 
restarting on ___.
- Rectal adenocarcinoma: Stool softeners should be held until 
frequency and consistency of BM normalizes.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ w/ anal mucinous adenocarcinoma not yet on
chemo, AFib on coumadin, UPJ obstruction s/p stent placement in
___ c/b chronic Klebsiella bacturia, IgG myeloma on
lenolidamide, currently residing at ___, who is referred from clinic by her primary
oncologist for rectal pain and expedited management of her 
rectal
ca.

She had reportedly mentioned worsening rectal pain over the past
several days as well as bright red blood on the tissue paper. 
She
denies melanotic stools. 

She had labs checked at the outpatient office today which showed
Hct of 29.3, which is roughly baseline. Because of her lack of
follow through but interest to pursue surgery, she was directly
admitted for pain control and surgical evaluation. 

ED: VS ___ HR 106-124, BP 107/76-136/82, RR 15, 100% RA. 
Received
5 mg IV morphine. Initial labs in ___ ED showed Hct of 15, but
was 27.7 when rechecked. Before the recheck, GI was consulted 
for
a possible GI bleed and plan was to admit to ICU. She received 5
mg IV Vit K. However in absence of frank melanotic stools with a
H/H that was baseline just several hours prior to admission, the
low Hg was suspected to be erroroneous and on recheck Hct 27.7.

She was evaluated by colorectal surgery who recommended
""admission to medicine for appropriate oncologic evaluation and
pain management. We recommend she be evaluated by radiation
oncology for short course pre-op radiation, followed by
proctectomy and end colostomy.""

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old woman with a history of afib, HTN, 
multiple myeloma and anal adenocarcinoma T4 diagnosed ___ 
with delayed treatment until progression ___ s/p radiation 
therapy and admitted for planned abdominal/perineal resection 
with small bowel resection with end colostomy, fiducial seed 
placement and perineal closure. There were extensive adhesions 
and it was converted to an open procedure totalling 8 hrs. 
During that time she had 1L estimated blood loss. 6 hrs in, her 
pressures dropped to 60's systolic and she received 4 units 
PRBC, 2 units FFP, albumin, and 6 liters LR. She nevertheless 
required phenylephrine and levophed. There was no significant 
bleeding at closure. She had a perineal flap with subcutaneous 
JP drain on the right, end ostomy, and pelvic JP drain on the 
left. 

In the PACU she remained intubated and continued to be 
hypotensive and received 2 units platelets and 2 units FFP. 
Esmolol gtt was attempted to control RVR to 140's without 
success and was stopped. EKG showed afib with RVR and no 
evidence of ischemia. 

Labs were notable for crit 32->22 post op, platelets dropped to 
39 and INR rose 1.2->2.4. She was transferred to the FICU where 
she had no overt signs of bleeding/oozing but remained 
hypotensive requiring vasopressin addition. A massive 
transfusion protocol was initiated, intraosseous line placed 
while awaiting a trauma line. She was transfused 5 untis of 
blood, ___ with appropriate bump in platelets and improvement 
in INR. 

Phenylephrine was stopped and pressures were maintained with LR

Reports:
=======================
___: KUB
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of unanticipated foreign body. 

___: Chest
IMPRESSION:  
ET tube tip is 4.7 cm above the carinal. NG tube tip is 2 
proximal, at the gastroesophageal junction and should be 
advanced. Right internal jugular line tip is in the right 
atrium. 
  
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is substantially increased 
potentially due to very low lung volumes with bibasal 
consolidations. Nodular opacity in the right lower lobe is not 
well seen on the previous examination, might represent summation 
of shadows and should be reassessed on subsequent imaging. The 
findings might in fact represent a combination of low lung 
volumes and mild pulmonary edema. 

___: Hand XR
IMPRESSION:   
There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation.  No osteopenia 
is present. Mild deformity at the distal interphalangeal joint 
of the second finger is present associated with soft tissue 
swelling but no evidence of erosions is present.  First 
carpometacarpal joint osteophytes are present, overall finding 
that are most likely consistent with osteoarthritis. 

___ RUQ U/S:
1. Normal liver echogenicity. 
2. Mild right hydronephrosis with prominent extrarenal pelvis 
and right 
ureteric stent. 

___ CXR:
Dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach.  Right central venous line 
tip is at the level of the right atrium. No change in large 
bilateral pleural effusions and vascular congestion 
demonstrated. Left PICC line tip is at the level of lower SVC. 

___ CT head:
No acute intracranial process.  If further imaging evaluation is 
indicated, MRI would be more sensitive than CT. 

___ LUE ultrasound:
1. Non-occlusive thrombus in the left internal jugular vein. 
2. Occlusive thrombus around the PICC line in one of the left 
brachial veins. 
No evidence of thrombus around the portion of the PICC line 
within the 
subclavian vein

Labs on discharge:
=======================

 
Brief Hospital Course:
FICU course:
___ F with history of multiple melanoma on revlimid, afib, 
ureteropelvic  obstruction s/p stent ___ c/b persistent 
Klebsiella bacteruria, anal adenocarcinoma with delayed 
treatment s/p radiation ___, s/p planned abdominal/perineal 
resection with small bowel resection with end colostomy, 
fiducial seed placement and perineal closure, transferred to 
FICU for hypotension. Course complicated by AMS due to delirium, 
A fib with RVR, and pseudomonal infection.  She was transferred 
to the floor on ___. Floor course was remarkable for wound 
dehiscence, continued afib with occasional RVR and ongoing 
delirium. 

# Hypotension: Most likely due to volume loss (8hr procedure 
with persistent oozing) compounded by third spacing from SIRS 
DIC response with hypoalbuminemia and anesthesia with delayed 
renal clearance and finaly RVR with poor filling time. Estimated 
blood loss was 1L though poorly quantified given the extent of 
the procedure. Intraop she received 6L crystalloid, 4 PRBC, and 
albumin (by report though unable to find in OMR), and her post 
op crit nevertheless dropped from 32 to 22.  Post op bleeding 
possible with DIC (INR 1.2->2.4) and thrombocytopenia nadir 39, 
though there are no outward signs of blood loss- hemostasis was 
noted at closure, the incisions have been dry with no 
significant drains putting out appropriate though dark 
serosanguanous fluid. Patient required pressor support with 
phenylephrine, noepinephrine, and vasopressin post-operatively. 
Patient was empirically covered with vanc/zosyn briefly, though 
this was discontinued given no clear source of infection. 
Patient experienced recurrent hypotension on ___ after 
returning from OR on ___. This was felt to be due to 
intra-operative blood loss and fluid shifts. She received 1U 
PRBCs on ___ intra-operatively and again on ___ due to drop in 
H/H. BP improved with IVF bolus, blood transfusions, and 
improved control of A fib with RVR.

# DIC: INR rose 1.2-> 2.4, platelets dipped to 39 with 
occasionaly schistos. This is likely from the procedure, no 
evidence of infection, and it appears to have responded to FFP 
with stable fibrinogen not requiring cryo. No evidence of 
petichiae, no appreciable oozing from lines and wounds. SQ 
heparin was discontinued, then restarted on ___ once platelets > 
50. Thrombocytopenia improved during ICU course. It gradually 
resolved and normalized by ___.  

# Afib: Previously on warfarin and rate controlled with dilt, 
bridged with lovenox and dilt recently decreased to 120 due to 
soft systolics during previous admission. Patient was controlled 
with dilt gtt and was also briefly on amiodarone. Patient was 
then transitioned to PO metoprolol and diltiazem for ongoing 
rate control. 

# Anal Mucinous Adenocarcinoma 
Diagnosed in ___. Restaging ___ showed T4 disease extending  
beyond the anal verge, progressing through external muscle of  
anal sphincter, progression from 3 months ago. Per report she is 
status post 5 fractions XRT per Drs. ___, completed 
___. Patient underwent abdominal/perineal resection with small 
bowel resection with end colostomy, fiducial seed placement and 
perineal closure on ___. Underwent flap debridement, local flap 
advancement closure on ___. She was started on ancef on ___ 
per plastic surgery, to be continued until all JP drains 
removed. She was also started on flagyl post-operatively 
___. Deep wound culture from OR on ___ grew Pseudomonas, 
sparse growth, for which she was started on cefepime on ___. She 
was switched to IV cipro based on sensitivities and antibiotics 
were discontinued on ___. The Right side JP was removed on ___ 
as well since the opening of wound exposed the JP to air and was 
not able to hold suction.  The Left side JPs were left in place. 
  

#wound: midline wound dehisced, requiring wet to dry dressing 
changes daily. It is in the proximity of the ostomy and 
application of wound vac would be very difficult to manage at 
this location. we continued with wet to dry dresssing allowing 
it to heal via second intention.
 
#thromboses: patient with new LUE swelling on ___, found to have 
thrombosis associated with PICC on U/S. Also has non-occlussive 
L IJ thrombosis, likely secondary to prior trauma line. 
Discontinued PICC ___ and patient was not anticoagulated, after 
discussion with surgery and heme/onc the decision was not to 
anti-coagulate due to ongoing wound complications and poor 
overall prognosis.   

#AMS: most likely secondary to ICU delirium with waxing and 
waning mental status. Mental status improved significantly 
during ICU course and patient was placed on seroquel qhS PRN.  
This was continued while on the floor. Her mentation did not 
improve much and has ongoing delirium. 

# Lactic acidosis: Combination of tissue disruption from surgery 
and hypoperfusion from above. Lactate improved with improved BP.

#nutrition: patient with low albumin and pre-albumin levels with 
poor nutrtional status likely contributing to poor wound 
healing. She was restarted on TFs post-operatively when cleared 
by surgery. She was seen by ___ who recommended soft solids and 
thin liquids, along with supplemental tube feeds. A dobhoff was 
placed and bridled in the ICU. We continued TF at goal after she 
was transferred to the floor. She tolerated the TF without 
issues.  

# left ___ finger fracture: no op.

short-course radiation therapy.

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - always.
Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.

Activity Status: Bedbound.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after an open abdominoperineal 
resection and perineal closure with flap for surgical management 
of your advanced anal adenocarcinoma. You are still recovering 
from this procedure and will need additional time for healing at 
a longterm care facility.  
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel  
movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable, however it 
is important that you have a bowel movement in the next ___ 
days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have 
some decrease in bowel function but you should not have 
prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small 
amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected. However, if 
you notice that you are passing bright red blood with bowel 
movements or having loose stool without improvement please call 
the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are 
severe. If you are taking narcotic pain medications there is a 
risk that you will have some constipation. Please take an over 
the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms 
do not improve call the office. If you have any of the following 
symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the 
emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, 
increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to 
tolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose stool, or extended 
constipation.  
 
You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed 
with staples. This incision can be left open to air or covered 
with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become 
irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in place until 
your first post-operative visit at which time they can be 
removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse. Please 
monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the 
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a 
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. You may 
shower, let the warm water run over the incision line and pat 
the area dry with a towel, do not rub.  
 
No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless 
instructed otherwise by your surgical team. You may gradually 
increase your activity as tolerated but clear heavy exercise 
with your surgical team.  
 
You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication. 
Please take this medication exactly as prescribed. You may take 
Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take more than 
4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while taking 
narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive a car 
while taking narcotic pain medication.  
 
Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope 
is that you will have a quick return to your life and usual

ready to return home. You have tolerated a regular diet, passing 
 
gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. 
You may return home to finish your recovery.  
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel  
movement prior to your discharge which is acceptable, however it 
is important that you have a bowel movement in the next ___ 
days. After anesthesia it is not uncommon for patients to have 
some decrease in bowel function but your should not have 
prolonged constipation. Some loose stool and passing of small 
amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected however, if 
you notice that you are passing bright red blood with bowel your 
please seek medical attention. If you are passing loose stool 
without improvement please call the office or go to the 
emergency room if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking 
narcotic pain medications there is a risk that you will have 
some constipation. Please take an over the counter stool 
softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms does not improve 
call the office. It is also not uncommon after an ileostomy 
takedown to have frequent loose stools until you are taking more 
regular food however this should improve.  
The muscles of the sphincters have not been used in quite some 
time and you may experience urgency or small amounts of 
incontinence however this should improve. If you do not show 
improvement in these symptoms within ___ days please call the

___ CXR
Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of the right 
ventricular outflow tract.  The double tube has been removed.  
There is substantial distension of the stomach that might 
potentially benefit from the NG tube insertion.  What appears to 
be a E ureteral stent is partially imaged. Bilateral pleural 
effusions, right more than left are present. Vascular congestion 
is noted, borderline with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 

___ KUB
1. A right double J stent projects over the expected location of 
the right renal pelvis and bladder.  The stent is unchanged in 
position since ___. 
2. The stomach is distended with air. 

___ TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated 
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. 
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild 
to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild 
to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman a PMH significant for AFib on 
coumadin, UPJ obstruction s/p stent placement in ___ c/b 
chronic Klebsiella bacturia, IgG myeloma on lenolidamide, and 
adenocarcinoma of the anal canal (followed by Dr. ___ 
admitted to ___ for evaluation of anemia (Hgb 8.6) with 
course complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR requiring ICU 
admission for dilt gtt, Acute of chronic kidney injury, 
?osteomyelitis from sacral decubitus ulcer now transferred to 
___ for debridement of sacral ulcer.  Became hypotensive and 
quite anemic on the floor with H/H of ___ and was transferred 
to the MICU ___. 
  She peacefully passed away with her family and family pastor 
present in the room at ___ on ___. 
 
#Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The pt consistently required 
nasal cannula up to 6 L while on the floor. This was thought to 
be due to volume overload and increased work of breathing. While 
in the CCU pt became more lethargic and an ABG showed 
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She was intubated by 
anesthesia.  CXR showed large bilateral pleural effusions and 
she was grossly anasarcic.  IP placed a right chest tube to 
drain the effusion which showed that it was malignant with 
cytology showing adenocarcinoma.  She was extubated successfully 
on ___ and was weaned down to room air thereafter.  She was 
able to be comfortable on room air for the rest of her 
admission.

# Encephalopathy: although the pt's mental status had noticed to 
be declining on the floor, she was still able to answer 
appropriately. After extubation, the pt was noted to be very 
lethargic and minimally responsive. EEG was done which showed 
triphasic waves consistent with an encephalopathy. The pt was 
trialed on Ativan and Keppra. Her mental status remained very 
poor in spite of continued Keppra.  Neuro signed off after head 
imaging was unrevealing.  Mental status continued to wax and 
wane through the rest of her time. 

# Stage IV surgical dehiscence: Patient had correction of 
abdominoperineal resection defect with a right vertical rectus 
abdominis muscular cutaneous flap in ___ following 
resection of anal cancer. She presented to the hospital with 
stage IV, MRSA + sacral ulcer with concern for osteomyelitis, as 
wound probes to bone. CT scan with no mention of sacral 
osteomyelitis. GI deferred to plastics as they did flap surgery. 
Plastics does not recommend surgical intervention at this time. 
MRI shows no signs of osteomyelitis. This wound remained stable 
during her hospital course. 

# ___: Baseline Creatinine 0.8. Creatinine on admission was 2.1 
in setting of diuresis but also possible hypotension from afib 
with RVR. Pt is grossly volume overloaded with hypoalbumenemia. 
Concern for prerenal vs. intrinsic with possible multiple 
myeloma involvement vs obstructive. Creatinine remains above 2.0 
today. Renal consulted and believed that her ___ was 
predominantly secondary to obstruction. After stent exchange by 
urology ___, renal function improved with a Cr to 1.5 with IV 
fluids and remained stable. 
 
# Gastric Distension: Patient developed nausea and 1 episode of 
vomiting ___ with increasing distention. And xray ___ 
showed significant gastric distension. NG tube was placed and 
>1L was drawn off. Patient's reported symptomatic improvement. 
Patient continued to have ostomy output throughout episode. No 
mass appreciated on exam though obese abdomen. Patient not on 
narcotic medication. On ___, NG tube was clamped without 
recurrence of distention, patient denies nausea or distension. 
Unable to get CT abd due to poor kidney function, but got OSH CT 
read by our radiologists. It was notable for new retroperitoneal 
mass encasing aorta throughout abdomen. It is touching and 
possibly invading ___ and ___ portion of duodenum, potentially 
explaining gastric obstruction symptoms. Invades pancreatic 
head, explaining ductal dilatation. Also surrounding common 
iliac vessels, and both ureters (hydronephrosis worse since 
___. Speech and swallow was consulted who said the pt 
should be strict NPO. Tube feeds were started.  

# Tube feeds: On ___ Ms. ___ was no longer tolerating 
her tube feeds due to very high residuals.  Tube feeds were 
stopped and she was given nutrition with D5NS at 75/hr.  ___ 
attempted to place the Dobhoff tube post-pyloric but they were 
unable to pass the tube through the pylorus and noted contrast 
barely trickles through ___ obstruction. In family meetings the 
family was informed that the feeding tube could not be advanced, 
and that other options such as TPN would likely harm the pt more 
than help her because of her risk for bloodstream infection and 
metabolic derangements.  

# Metastatic anal adenocarcinoma: large retroperitoneal mass 
compressing the abdomen and constricting the aorta at the level 
of the iliacs noted on CT from OSH, thought to be metastasis 
from her known anal adenocarcinoma. Per onc, not a candidate for 
chemotherapy, so likely not worth biopsying even though 
definitive diagnosis would not otherwise be reached. Recommend 
getting palliative care involved and having goals of care 
discussion with family.  First family meeting was ___ and 
son, ___, wanted us to do everything we could to help Ms. 
___. This continued to be a theme during her hospital stay, 
and several meetings were held with the family to discuss goals 
of care.  On ___ it was decided to switch to focusing on her 
comfort only.

# Volume overload: Likely from diastolic heart failure but will 
need to rule out hypoalbuminemic state, and cirrhosis. Patient 
with gross volume overload with 2+ ___ edema, bilateral effusions 
and CT with anasarca on abdominal imaging.  TTE unchanged from 
previous with EF 55% and no gross valvular dysfunction. TSH 
elevated, T4 WNLs. Patient given albumin ___ with good 
response.  However, patient still significantly overloaded.  On 
___ she was anuric and hypotensive despite having 
significant lower extremity and abdominal edema.  She was 
transferred to the MICU on this day.  While in the MICU she was 
stabilized and pressors were downtitrated.  Poor response to 
Lasix alone but given Lasix and Chlorothiazide with good UOP.  
 
# Hematuria: Unclear cause but patient was on anticoagulation. 
Concern would be primarily for tumor infiltration. Hematuria 
intermittent, but seems to recur during transport. Potential 
mechanical irritation. Patient continues to pass dime sized 
clots. Stent exchange done ___ by urology, with improvement in 
her hematuria.  Hematuria with clots returned on ___.  
Urology recommended CBI which was started ___.  She had 
CBI intermittently throughout her stay to relieve foley 
obstructions. 
 
# Normocytic Anemia: Hgb at ___ 8.6. No evidence of 
bleeding. She does have stage III CKD. MCV within normal range 
and iron studies not particularly suggestive of iron deficiency 
anemia with ferritin of 781. Folate level of 7.4 and B12 of 411. 
Concern could possibly be for chronic low grade bleed from gut 
or hematuria. (transfused evening of ___.  Hgb remained 
stable in the 7's until ___ when H/H dropped to ___.  
This same day she triggered for hypotension of 86/Doppler.  As 
she was anuric at this  time there was concern of intraabdominal 
bleeding and was one of the indications for MICU transfer.  Pt 
had episode of gross hematuria requiring CBI and pRBC 
transfusion for BP control.  Pt required Vasopressin and 
Phenylephrine while in the MICU but was able to be weaned off.  
She required intermittent pRBC transfusions during her time in 
the MICU.
 
# AFib on coumadin: CHADS 2 of 3. Hemodynamically unstable with 
RVR upon arrival, but controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol.  
She remained in AFib during her hospital stay.  Due to her 
hematuria and dropping H/H, blood pressure medications and 
ultimately SQH were discontinued on ___.   Pt put on an 
esmolol gtt as she had afib with RVR into the 130s on her first 
day in the ICU. She was taken off the esmolol drip and 
thereafter controlled with IV metoprolol and achieved good 
control on PO metoprolol with heart rates in the ___. 

# Hypertension: Currently normotensive.  See above for issues 
with hypotension and reason for MICU transfer ___. 
 
# IgG Myeloma: Patient with longstanding IgG MM, followed by 
___ Oncology. Currently not on revlimid or dexamethasone. 
Kappa:lamba increase, but can be seen in kidney disease.  Atrius 
oncology followed patient throughout hospital stay.

STUDIES
==========================================================
___ EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU 
monitoring study because of a discontinuous background 
throughout the recording, characterized by ___ Hz theta 
frequency activity with admixed delta activity and occasional 
suppressions, consistent with a moderate to several 
encephalopathy. Background reactivity is present as seen during 
bedside examination when a more continuous and higher voltage 
theta frequency activity is observed. There are no definite 
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. Note is made 
of an irregular cardiac rhythm throughout the recording with an 
average heart rate of 70 to 130 bpm on a single channel EKG. 

___ ECG Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Non-diagnostic Q 
waves in leads I and aVL. Borderline intraventricular conduction 
delay of the left bundle-branch block type. ST-T wave 
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison. 
Clinical correlation is suggested. TRACING ___ CXR IMPRESSION: 1. Widened mediastinum may reflect low lung 
volumes and supine positioning, however mediastinal great vessel 
injury cannot be excluded. If concern exists, recommend chest 
CTA. 2. Pulmonary vascular congestion and probable mild 
pulmonary edema. 3. Bibasilar atelectasis. 4. ET tube with tip 6 
cm above carina. Enteric tube with tip projecting over stomach 
fundus. 

___ CT SPINE 1. No acute fracture or malalignment. 2. 
Heterogeneously enlarged left thyroid gland with punctate 
calcification suggestive of a goiter. Consider thyroid 
ultrasound if the patient has not had one previously if the 
patient's condition stabilizes. 3. Mild pulmonary edema. 

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial 
hemorrhage or mass effect. 2. Subtle subcortical white matter 
hypodensity in the right frontal lobe which is nonspecific, 
potentially related to chronic small vessel infarction, but can 
also be seen with vasculitis, demyelination, or infection. This 
can be further assessed with MRI. 

___ CTA CHEST AND ABDOMEN IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of 
pulmonary embolism to the segmental level. 2. Fusiform dilation 
to 53 mm of the extrahepatic common hepatic and common bile duct 
as well as the cystic duct, compatible with type I choledochal 
cyst. Hyperdense anti-dependent material within the gallbladder 
lumen may represent sludge, however underlying mass lesion is 
also of concern. Recommend non-urgent MRCP for further 
evaluation of biliary system and gallbladder when clinically 
appropriate. 3. A 3.5 cm heterogeneous, potentially enhancing 
left renal lesion, concerning for neoplasm. Patent ipsilateral 
renal vein. This could be further evaluated at the time of 
followup MRI/MRCP. 4. Ill-defined segment VII hypodense liver 
lesion. Attention on followup imaging. 5. Possible non-displaced 
sternal fracture. 6. Appropriately-positioned ET tube and 
enteric tube. 7. Mild pulmonary edema which is most conspicuous 
in the lung apices. Bibasilar atelectasis. 8. Mildly 
heterogeneous thyroid is partially imaged. 

___ ECHO The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis 
(LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall 
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

___ CXR IMPRESSION: 1. Slight interval worsening of vascular 
congestion and mild pulmonary edema. Additionally, the heart 
appears slightly larger. 2. High position of the endotracheal 
tube, 7 cm from the carina. Advance 2-3 cm for more secure 
placement. 

___ CXR IMPRESSION: Subtle new confluent opacity in the right 
perihilar region,? related to subtle progression of CHF 
findings. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. 
Attention to this area on followup films is requested. 

ERCP report
___ 
Impression: Bulging of the major papilla 
Biliary dilation compatible with cholydocal cyst. 
A 5cm by ___ straight plastic biliary stent was placed 
successfully. Brisk drainage of cloudy bile and contrast from 
the biliary tree was noted endoscopically and fluoroscopically.  
 
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum 

___ CXR IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and 
support devices are essentially unchanged. The patient has taken 
a somewhat better inspiration. Nevertheless, there is 
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bibasilar 
opacifications.

s/p PEA arrest, septic shock on 3 pressors, and ___.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# PEA arrest: Unclear precipitant, but most likely metabolic 
derangement in the setting of diarrhea, leading to bicarbonate 
losses and consequential hypokalemia, acidosis, and hypovolemia 
driving an arrhythmia. While he had shortness of breath, hypoxia 
does not seen likely. Bedside echo did not show any evidence of 
tamponade and CXR/CT did not show evidence of tension 
pneumothorax. EKG and echo also did not support ACS. Serum tox 
does not favor a toxin ingestion.  He was maintained at strict 
normothermia for 48 hours. 

# Septic Shock: Patient presented in septic shock.  Source most 
likely cholangitis. Hypotension was refractory to volume 
resussitation and was required 3 pressors. Patient was found to 
have cholangitis and E. coli bacteremia which was treated as 
below. 

# AF with RVR: Patient presented with new onset afib with RVR. 
the pt has no history of AF. Tachycardia is likely induced by 
the use of multiple pressors, especially epinephrine. Due to 
patients hypotension he was loaded with amiodarone and 
transitioned to PO amiodarone. He then receieved dilt and then 
verapamil for additional attempts at rate control. He was in 
sinus rhythm on floor transfer. Started on coumadin 3mg on ___. 
Cardiology was consulted and recommended discontinuing 
amiodarone and verapamil and starting the patient on metoprolol 
and an ACEI. Metoprolol was started and titrated to 150mg upon 
discharge. He was not started on lisinopril 5mg as his renal 
function had just recovered. Patient should start lisinopril on 
___. 

# ___: Pt likely has some CKD at baseline, as Cr in ___ was 
1.7. Rapid rise in Cr unlikely to occur suddednly in setting of 
septic shock.  Urine microscopy with many muddy brown casts, 
unsuprising given his arrest and severe septic shock.  With 
prolonged dehydration and cardiac arrest, likely pre-renal 
azotemia developed into ATN. His uric acid level of 17.7 is very 
elevated and makes uric acid nephropathy possible and uric acid 
cystals were seen on urine microscopy. Per mother, took ___ 
and indomethacin for perhaps a few days prior to this event. 
Because of volume overload and low urine output patient was 
treated with continuous renal replacement therapy which was 
continued until ___. His renal function continued to improve, 
and he should be started on ACEI for heart failure on ___, in 
order to give his kidneys time to recover. On discharge, he 
appeared to be in post-ATN diuresis, so patient should be 
encouraged to keep hydrated with careful monitoring of I/O after 
discharge. 

# Respiratory failure: Not ARDS. Likely ___ cardiac arrest and 
acidosis. Pt initally had severe metabolic acidosis and 
permitted to hyperventilate to compensate.  Due to patients 
kidney injury and aggressive fluid resussitation. TTE showed EF 
25%, global hypokinesis, unclear chronicity. 

# Cholangitis and E. coli bacteremia:  Elevated LFTs in the 
setting of dilated CBD on imaging with choledochal cyst was 
suggestive of underlying cholangitis. ERCP findings included 
Cloudy bile, no frank pus. Ampulla was found to have with edema 
and erythema, possibly site of obstruction. ___ CBD stent placed 
in CBD, good bile flow after placement. Patient improved rapidly 
after ERCP and should continue ceftriaxone and flagyl until 
___. He will need surgery and ERCP follow-up for cyst removal 
and stent removal. 
 
# Thrombocytopenia: Unlikely a consumptive process as fibrinogen 
elevated and INR only midly elevated, making DIC unlikely. Heme 
was consulted to rule out TTP in setting of liver and renal 
dysfunction. Ehrlichia/anaplasmosis was negative. 
Thrombocytopenia was likely due to sepsis, and recovered quickly 
after source control for cholangitis. 

# Hyperglycemia: Pt had low FSBG on presentation at OSH and 
received 1 amp. He then became hyperglycemic in setting of 
sepsis and required insulin drip during that time.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please start lisinopril 5mg on ___ if kidney function 
stable. Patient needs ACEI for likely acute heart failure, 
however needs a week prior to starting due to ___. 
-Patient in post-ATN diuresis. Encourage PO intake, monitor I/O 
and blood pressures to make sure he is not dehydrated. 
- Patient started on warfarin on ___ at 3mg due to concurrent 
use of flagyl. It was increased to 5mg on ___. Please monitor 
INR.
-Scheduled for appointments with surgery, ERCP, urology (concern 
for renal mass), and cardiology. 
- Does not need renal follow-up, but please schedule if kidney 
function worse or if metabolic acidosis does not resolve.
-Per cardiology, will continue warfarin, metoprolol, and 
lisinopril until his follow-up appointment. At that time, he 
will need repeat echo to assess LV function and may need an 
event monitor to determine whether he is still having episodes 
of A-fib.
- Recent CT scan showed a ""3.5 cm heterogeneous, potentially 
enhancing left renal lesion, concerning for neoplasm"". Warrants 
further evaluation by Urology once he recovers 
- Outpatient surgery f/u for choledochal cyst resection 
- ERCP f/u to take out stent

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted 
with weakness and diarrhea and were found to have an infection 
in your abdomen. You also experienced an event where your heart 
stopped and you were very ill afterwards. Your symptoms 
gradually improved with antibiotics and a procedure to place a 
stent in the duct your gallbladder drains into, and we gave you 
medication to control your heart rate. Our cardiology team saw 
you and started you on several new medications to protect your 
heart. You will need to go to rehab to regain your strength and 
will need to see several specialists, listed below, after you 
leave the hospital. Please follow-up with your appointments as 
listed below.

Please note that your CT scan showed a mass in your kidney which 
should be evaluated by Urology as an outpatient, as there is 
concern this could be a cancer. You will also need surgery to 
remove the cyst around your gallbladder to prevent future events 
like this from occurring. You also need to follow-up with 
cardiology to reassess your heart function and adjust your 
medications.

Take care, and we wish you the best.

Sincerely,
Your ___ medicine team

transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. He arrived on Neo with increased CT 
drainage for the firt few hours and received plts, protamine and 
2 units of cells. The bleeding resolved. He remained intubated 
overnight due to hemodynamic instability. He extubated the 
morning of POD#1. He was found to be  alert and oriented x 2 and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
but mildly confused.  He remained hypotensive, requiring volume 
and a-pacing. Over the next ___ hrs he became more confused he 
pulled out his central line and chest tubes without incident. He 
has a history of alcohol use and was placed on CIWA scale. He 
remained in the unit for several days due to his confusion. He 
eventully improved and was transferred to the floor.  Beta 
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward 
the preoperative weight.  Pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy 
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  On post-op 
#7 he fell on the floor afterwards he complained of left 
shoulder pain, but a follow-up radiograph revealed no fracture.  
By the time of discharge on post-operative day eight the patient 
was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was 
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to 
home in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

None
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with a hx of CAD (s/p DES to LAD in 
___ 
who presented today for a routine stress echo (ordered by his 
PCP) and was found to have evidence of inducible ischemia and 
severe aortic insuficiency. The patient was in his usual state 
of health prior to the stress test. He retired from his 
___ job of ___ years just 3 days ago. While on the 
treadmill the patient developed left shoulder pain (similar to 
previous anginal pains) and ST changes on EKG. Echocardiography 
revealed 4+ aortic regurgitation (patient was noted to be 1+ on 
last echo in ___. After getting off the treadmill the pain 
went away and he felt back to baseline. The patient has 
otherwise been asymptomatic. He exercises 3 times per week and 
will notice faint chest pain only with maximal exercise. He 
denies shortness of breath, PND, lower extremity edema and 
orthopnea. He has not noticed any fevers, chills, night sweats, 
or weight loss. 

After the stress test the patient was sent straight to the ED. 
In the ED he had an EKG which reportedly showed no ischemic 
changes. He had a CTA chest which was negative for aortic 
dissection. He was then admitted to the cardiology service for 
further management. 

Currently the patient is asymptomatic although he is 
considerably distressed by this new diagnosis. 
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, 
 cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent 
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf 
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  
 
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on 
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, 
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ETT (___) with ECHO:  
Anginal type symptoms with borderline ischemic EKG changes at a 
high cardiac demand and good functional capacity. Resting 
systolic hypertension with blunted hemodynamic response to 
physiologic stress. Echo report sent separately. Patient 
transferred to ED for further evaluation. Dr. ___. 
 
The patient exercised for 8 minutes 45 seconds according to a 
___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate 
of 129 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 158/56 mmHg. The test 
was stopped because of anginal pain and ST changes (see exercise 
report for details). This level of exercise represents an 
average/good exercise tolerance for age. In response to stress, 
the ECG showed ischemic ST changes in the setting of abnormal 
resting ECG (see exercise report for details). Resting systolic 
hypertension with blunted blood pressure response to stress. 
There was a blunted heart rate response to stress [beta 
blockade]. 
 
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 105 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 158/68 mmHg. These demonstrated normal left 
ventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic function. 
Right ventricular free wall motion is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. The ascending aorta diameter is normal. No 
dissection flap is suggested by 2D or color flow Doppler (does 
not exclude). Doppler demonstrated severe aortic regurgitation 
and mild mitral regurgitation with no aortic stenosis or 
significant resting LVOT gradient. 
Echo images were acquired within 58 seconds after peak stress at 
heart rates of 125 - 112 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate 
augmentation of all segments. 
 
IMPRESSION: Good functional exercise capacity. Borderline 
ischemic ST changes with 2D echocardiographic evidence of severe 
resting aortic regurgitation and no inducible wall motion 
abnormalities. Blunted heart rate and blood pressure response to 
exercise. Severe aortic regurgitation at rest. Mild mitral 
regurgitation at rest. 
If clinically indicated, a thoracic CT/MR or TEE is suggested to 
evaluate for possible aortic dissection. A TEE would be best 
able to assess the aortic valve for possible vegetations.  

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity 
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is 
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate to 
severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
findings are similar.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
========================================
Mr. ___ is a ___ with a hx of CAD (s/p DES to LAD in 
___ who presented for a routine stress echo and was found to 
have evidence of inducible ischemia and aortic insuficiency. 
  
ACTIVE ISSUES:
=======================
#) Aortic Insufficiency: Unclear etiology. Dissection was ruled 
out by CTA. There was no root dilation seen on TTE so more 
likely it is valvular in origin. Patient had no clinical signs 
of endocarditis and blood cultures had no growth to date. Most 
likely this is not acute AI given absence of symptoms other than 
during stress test. It is unclear how long it has been 
progressing for however. As for chronic etiologies, patient does 
not have a marfanoid habitus. He did however have a spontaneous 
subarachnoid hemorrhage which may or may not be related. RPR was 
negative. He did have mantle field radiation for Hodgkins in the 
1970s that could theoretically have contributed. On repeat 
echocardiogram patient did not have LV dilatation and EF was 
>60%. Clinically he did not have any signs of heart failure. 
- Since the patient is asymptomatic and appears to be 
compensated there was no urgent need for surgical evaluation. 
The patient was therefore scheduled to follow-up with his 
cardiologist, Dr. ___ to pursue further workup as an 
outpatient. 
- He was started on lisinopril for afterload reduction and 
diltiazem was stopped
  
#) Positive Stress Test/Hx of CAD: Patient had reversible EKG 
changes and anginal symptoms while on treadmill. He is known to 
have coronary artery disease which may have progressed. However 
it may be that he had demand ischemia from his aortic 
insufficiency that was further compounding the problem. There 
were no inducible wall motion abnormalities to suggest a 
significant functional problem. Since the stress test was 
performed for stable angina there is no evidence that PCI would 
have any benefit over medical therapy. Therefore he was 
discharged to follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. ___ 
further evaluation.  
- Could consider left heart cath as outpatient if patient has 
ischemic symptoms or is being evaluated for AVR
- Patient had difficulty tolerating statins because of myalgias 
therefore he will continue Niacin and Omega 3 fatty acids. LDL 
was 145 which is significantly above goal of 70. More aggressive 
LDL control should be discussed at outpatient follow-up with his 
cardiologist. 
- Patient reports that he is not on beta blocker because of 
fatigue
- Continued ASA/Plavix 
  
CHRONIC ISSUES:
===================
#) Asthma: well controlled
- Continued budenoside    
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================
# Patient will follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. ___ 
further workup of his new Aortic Insufficiency, to discuss his 
stress test, and to discuss more aggressive LDL lowering
# CODE STATUS- DNR, Okay to intubate for procedures but would 
not want prolonged intubation.   
# EMERGENCY CONTACT- Ex wife (HCP) ___ ___

Conclusions  
Pre-CPB:
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 

There are multiple complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending 
thoracic aorta, at least two of which have mobile components. No 
thoracic aortic dissection is seen. There are three aortic valve 
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. 
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). 
Moderate (2+) central aortic regurgitation is seen. 

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. 

___ was notified in person of the results at time of 
study.

Post-CPB:
The ___ is on a phenylephrine infusion. There is a 
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. The valve appears 
well seated with normally mobile leaflets. There are no 
paravalvular leaks and no AI. The peak gradient across the 
aortic valve is 22mmHg, the mean gradient is 11mmHg with CO of 
4.1L/min.

The LV systolic function appears preserved. There is a period 
where inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis is noted. This 
resolves by the end of the case. This is possibly due to air in 
the graft. The RV systolic function is unchanged. 

The MR remains trace. There is no evidence of aortic dissection. 
The mobile atheroma in the descending aortia appear unchanged.   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
___ underwent an aortic valve replacement #21 ___ tissue 
valve, coronary artery bypass grafting times one (SVG to PDA).  
Overall the ___ tolerated the procedure well and

IMAGING
==================

___ MRI Head 
Diffusion abnormalities along the cortex of both cerebral 
hemispheres predominantly in the parieto-occipital lobes are 
suggestive of early ischemic brain injury. 

___ LENIs 
1.  Limited examination, but no evidence of deep vein thrombosis 
in the right upper extremity. 
2.  Probable hematoma in the upper inner arm as described.  
Correlate with 
physical examination for chronicity, and advise clinical 
follow-up to ensure resolution over time. 

___ TTE 
The left atrial volume index is normal. Normal left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic 
function (biplane LVEF = 64 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. No valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified. No pericardial 
effusion. 

___ EEG 
This is an abnormal ICU continuous video EEG monitoring study 
due to the presence of a burst suppression pattern, indicative 
of a severe ecphalopathy. By the late afternoon, overall 
amplitudes began to diminish, and more prolonged background 
attenuation was seen, with plentiful artifact. By the end of the 
recording, definitive activity of cerebral origin was not 
clearly seen. These findings are indicative of worsening of the 
severe encephalopathy, which could be related to medication 
effects, toxic/metabolic disturbances or progression of 
neurologic injury. There were no clear epileptiform discharges 
or electrographic seizures in this recording. 

___ Shoulder ___ views 
Displaced humeral head fracture corresponding to given history, 
with exact relation of fracture fragments difficult to identify 
given limited included two views. 

___ CXR 
AP portable supine view of the chest.  The endotracheal tube is 
positioned with its tip 3.8 cm above the carina.  There is a 
vague opacity in the right lower lung which could reflect a 
focus of pneumonia though attention on followup advised.  There 
is mild retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis.  No large 
effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal 
silhouette appears grossly unremarkable.  There is a 
dextroscoliotic curvature of the thoracic spine.  No acute bony 
abnormalities. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ was admitted to the MICU at ___ for post-cardiac 
arrest management. He received 5 rounds of CPR prior to ROSC. 
Unfortunately, despite obtaining ROSC, he suffered a devastating 
brain injury likely ___ anoxia. This was confirmed on MRI as 
well as with consult from the neurology team. After speaking 
with his HCP, we agreed to progress to CMO. He was extubated and 
expired on ___.

Imaging:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ___:
IMPRESSION:  
The lung volumes are low. The patient is intubated, the 
endotracheal tube 
projects approximately 2.6 cm above the carinal. The patient 
also has a 
nasogastric tube, the tip is not visualized on the image. 
Finally, the patient has a right internal jugular vein catheter. 
The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the 
catheter projects over the upper to mid SVC. 
  
Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and, 
potentially, a small left pleural effusion. The patient is ___ 
mild pulmonary edema. ___ addition, there is a rounded opacity at 
the lateral and lower aspect 's of the right hilus, potentially 
representing atelectasis. However, short term radiographic 
followup should be performed to exclude developing pneumonia or 
aspiration. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION:  
All of the pulmonary abnormalities could be due to atelectasis 
bilateral lower lobe, including collapse without bronchial 
obstruction.  Lesions ___ the posterior segment of the right 
upper lobe and particularly the lingula should be re-evaluated 
with chest CT, contrast enhanced if clinically feasible, when 
aeration improves elsewhere. Pulmonary hypertension. 
Cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Comparison across modalities to recent MRI is difficult. 
However, there is no significant change since outside CT of ___. Again there is nonspecific diffuse hypodensity of 
the white matter.  Possible hypodense area 
___ the left cerebellar hemisphere. 
2. Diffuse distribution is somewhat atypical for PRES although 
PRES can be seen ___ a non- posterior distribution. Repeat MRI 
may be helpful for further evaluation. 
3. New aerosolized secretions ___ the sphenoid sinuses, 
opacification of the left mastoid air cells and fluid ___ the 
left middle ear cavity. Please correlate clinically for acute 
sinusitis. 

EEG ___:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study 
because of frequent blunted epileptiform discharges ___ bilateral 
occipital regions. These, only on rare occasions, have a high 
voltage sharp morphology, ___ the bilateral posterior quadrants, 
phase reversing ___ a broad field isoelectric at O1 and O2 or at 
times with shifting laterality between each posterior quadrant. 
At times, these occur ___ brief runs at ___ Hz lasting up to 
five seconds ___ the first half of the recording but do not 
evolve ___ frequency, morphology, or location to meet criteria 
for seizure. ___ the latter half of the recording, the frequency 
of the brief runs decrease to 0.5-0.75 Hz and predominantly have 
only a blunted morphology. These sharp waves indicate 
potentially epileptogenic foci ___ both occipital regions. 
Additionally, there is a continuous pattern of severe diffuse 
background slowing fluctuating with a discontinuous burst 
suppression pattern throughout the entire recording. These 
findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction 
which is non-specific as to etiology. The fluctuations of the 
continuous and discontinuous background pattern could indicate 
either fluctuation ___ severity of the severe diffuse cerebral 
dysfunction or effects of sedating medications. 

EKG ___:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Prior anteroseptal and 
lateral 
myocardial infarction. Slight ST segment elevation ___ leads 
V1-V2 with 
ST segment depression and T wave inversion ___ leads I and aVL. 
ST segment 
flattening and slight depression ___ leads II and aVF. The ST-T 
wave changes raise the question of active anterolateral ischemic 
process. No previous tracing available for comparison. Clinical 
correlation is suggested.  

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___:
Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No 
thrombus/mass is seen ___ the body of the left atrium. No atrial 
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color 
Doppler or saline contrast at rest. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen ___ the left ventricle. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately 
dilated with normal free wall contractility. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is 
seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid 
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  

MRA MRA BRAIN/NECK W/O CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION:  
Study somewhat suboptimal; circle of ___ not completely 
included. 
Allowing for technical limitations, no flow-limiting stenosis or 
aneurysm more than 3mm  of the circle ___ or vessels of the 
neck. Consider repeat evaluation with better quality images when 
feasible. 

___ EEG

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because
of occasional blunted epileptiform discharges ___ the bilateral 
posterior
quadrants, phase reversing ___ a broad field isoelectric at O1 
and O2 or at
times with shifting laterality between each posterior quadrant. 
On rare
occasions, these discharges occur ___ brief ___ second runs at 
0.25-0.5 Hz but
do not evolve ___ frequency, morphology, or location to meet 
criteria for
seizure. These blunted epileptiform discharges indicate 
potentially
epileptogenic foci ___ both occipital regions. There is moderate 
to severe
diffuse background slowing, which is nonspecific as to etiology. 
Compared to
the previous days recording, the bilateral posterior quadrant 
epileptiform
discharges have decreased ___ frequency, and there is mild 
improvement ___ the
background.

___ CXR

IMPRESSION: 
 
Examination is centered at the diaphragm, excluding the lung 
apices. Moderate
cardiomegaly is stable, but mild interstitial edema may have 
improved. There
is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion along the 
imaged pleural
surfaces. Left PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial 
junction,
repositioned from the azygos vein. Feeding tube has been 
withdrawn to the
upper stomach. The side ports may not all be beyond the 
gastroesophageal
junction.

___ MRI (radiology read)

IMPRESSION: 
 
Several acute small subcortical infarcts are identified since 
the previous MRI
examination. There is been some decrease ___ hyperintensities ___ 
the basal
ganglia, brainstem and cerebellum and cerebral convexity 
regions. Extensive
changes still remain.

with SBP 230-250, N/V, HA, ultimately developing PRES and 
multiple lacunar infarcts with bleeding all thought to be ___ 
his hypertension. His medical course was complicated by 
hypercarbic respiratory failure possible ___ intermittent AMS vs 
HTN-associated pulmonary edema, persistently difficulty to 
control HTN, HTN-associated CKD, and chronic anemia ultimately 
felt to be anemia of chronic disease. He was discharged on 
multiple medications for blood pressure control, ASA, and 
atorvastatin. Evaluation by ___ on ___: home w/ home ___ & 
home OT and 24hr assist from family following 0 ___ visits. Will 
d/c with rx for standard wheelchair.

Hospital course

# Neuro - At OSH - MRI/MRV was done ___ and showed no MRV 
abnormality but did show diffuse FLAIR hyperintensity through 
the cerebral white matter, brainstem (worst ___ pons) and 
bilateral cerebellar white matter. Repeat MRI ___ showed
multiple bilateral cerebral white matter acute punctate infarcts 
(bright on DWI and dark on ADC) with associated GRE signal 
abnormality suggestive of bleed. After concern for acute stroke 
on MRI on ___, he was started on ASA 81 and
Atorvastatin. He reportedly had R sided weakness for multiple 
days prior to transfer but has been sedated on a propofol drip 
for intubation. On arrival, he had a clear R hemiparesis and 
possible L facial weakness. By the time of extubation and 
transfer to the floor Neurology service from the MICU, these 
symptoms had resolved. His mental status was notable for 
intermittent disorientation to month, year, and location. He had 
multiple anxiety episodes (which reportedly occurred frequently 
prior to admission as well) - these episodes improved with 
olanzapine which wasn't required for the 24 hours prior to 
discharge. He was started on qHS trazodone for insomnia and 
night time agitation. It may be worthwhile to repeat his MRI as 
an outpatient for prognostication purposes, though his exam is 
now clearly improved.

#Respiratory - Patient has been intubated 3x at OSH, each time 
for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  There is also question of 
patient have altered mental status which contributed to 
difficulty weaning from vent and need for intubation for airway 
protection. He was successfully extubated after arrival to the 
FICU on ___.

# CV - Patient with HAs, vision changes, elevated BP and CKD on 
admission to OSH.  Patient was kept on nitro gtt, IV hydral, IV 
metop, clonidine and IV enalapril during hospitalization at ___ 
___.  Initially maintained on nitro gtt. Gradual control of BPs 
(given history of strokes and given likely history of chronic 
HTN) was achieved with SBPs ___ the 120s to 150s with clonidine 
0.3 mg qDay (patch - changed qWk), carvedilol, lisinopril, and 
amlodipine. Clonidine can be weaned by 0.1 mg qWk over the next 
three weeks to off. Further HTN management will be directed by 
the renal service on an outpatient basis.  

# Renal: Patient with elevated creatinine and proteinuria on 
admission to OSH. Seen by nephrology at ___ who gave 
diagnosis of hypertensive nephropathy. Recommended BP control 
and initiation of Ace-inhibitor. Renal U/S at OSH was normal 
except for R renal cyst. Urine sediment reportedly bland. UA 
here unremarkable. Cr remains elevated and stable. Kidney biopsy 
performed ___. Preliminary results revealed endocapillary 
proliferation and some endothelial damage. There is evidence of 
chronic disease, arterial wall thickening, some GN. Most likely 
___ chronic kidney disease. Creatinine 2.6 on ___ creatinine 
2.8 on ___. OSH evaluation for pheo, thyroid abn, cortisol abn 
were unremarkable. Renin and aldosterone pending at the time of 
discharge. Renal dopplers limited by patient cooperation but 
overall unremarkable.

# ID - Patient grew GPCs ___ clusters ___ 2 bottles from cultures 
from ___.  Patient only had PIVs ___ place until ___.  Vanc 
sensitive. TTE without evidence of vegetation. Plan for 
vancomycin; will need two week course starting from date of 
first negative blood culture (last day ___. Also on ___, 
was found to have CXR c/f aspiration PNA. Completed 10 day 
course of IV Zosyn for this.

# Heme: Patient acutely developed an anemia with Hg drop from 
~11 to ___ over 24 hours, but then stable afterwards. Low 
reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin and haptoglobin were 
consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Given history of 
positive guaics (which resolved when the patient was put on a 
PPI), GI was consulted. EGD/Colonoscopy were unremarkable. Any 
further evidence of persistently guiaic positive stools should 
prompt capsule study. Renal felt that chronic renal disease 
could be contributing to anemia but EPO would not be recommended 
for the patient unless his anemia was long standing and until 
his BP was well controlled.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted with a hypertensive urgency with blood 
pressures as high as 240/110. This caused nausea/vomiting and 
headache and damage to your brain called posterior reversible 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on your Brain MRI. You also 
had multiple small strokes scattered throughout your brain on a 
repeat brain MRI. You initially required intubation for trouble 
breathing. You were transferred to one of our ICUs from another 
hospital for further management after it became difficult to 
extubate you. On admission, you had right sided weakness that 
improved over time. You were ultimately extubated and could 
breath on your own. Your blood pressure required multiple 
medications for management throughout the admission but we 
eventually kept your blood pressure controlled between 
___ on multiple blood pressure medications. You had a 
low red blood cell count (anemia) during the admission which we 
thought was likely because of the stress placed on your body 
(anemia of chronic disease). You had a scope of your upper and 
lower gut to look for other sources of bleeds but these were 
normal. You had a bacterial infection ___ your blood and a 
pneumonia that required treatment with IV Vancomycin and IV 
Zosyn for 12 days. Your kidneys also showed damage from your 
likely long standing high blood pressure. Our renal service 
evaluated you and a kidney biopsy was done to confirm this 
diagnosis. 
You have been evaluated by our physical therapists. They 
recommend discharge home with home physical therapy.
___ addition to the follow up appointments listed below, you will 
also require follow-up with a neurologist. Please obtain a 
referral from your primary care doctor.

Imaging
___ CXR :
Small left pneumothorax has developed following removal of the 
basal and 
medial pleural tube.  There is no appreciable left pleural 
effusion, but there is a small region of consolidation in the 
left lower lobe, which could be area of focal bleeding.  Right 
basal atelectasis is new.  Heart size normal. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the thoracic surgery service for a 
left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.  He was taken to the OR and 
underwent an uncomplicated VATS LLL lobectomy with placement of 
a chest tube.  He tolerated the procedure without complications 
and recovered uneventfully in the PACU before being transferred 
to the floor in stable condition.  (Please see the associated 
operative report for specific procedural details.)  
Post-operatively his pain was controlled with a PCA and IV pain 
medication with a transition to PO pain meds once tolerating 
POs.  His diet was advanced slowly and without difficulty.  His 
chest tube was removed on POD#2 without incident and his oxygen 
saturations were > 95% on room air. He was able to use his 
incentive spirometer effectively.

Unfortunately he failed one voiding trial which required 
replacement of his Foley catheter for an additional day.  His 
second voiding trial was successful and Flomax was also started. 
 He had some confusion with the use of Dilaudid but improved 
with Ultram and Tylenol. 

Upon standing up for a chest xray he had some dizziness and 
orthostatic signs were checked.  Lying, his BP was 114/70 with a 
heart rate of 78 and standing it was 80/42 with a heart rate of 
88.  He was initially treated with IV fluids and increasing his 
oral intake of liquids.  Despite doing that his orthostasis 
persisted and an EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation at a rate 
of 114. This was also associated with hypokalemia, 
hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia. After repleting his 
electrolytes and starting metoprolol, he converted back into 
sinus rhythm.

Of note, he had been on Lopressor as recent as ___ but 
after discussing the situation with his wife, she monitored him 
closely and noticed that his heart rate was in the 50's 
therefore stopped the lopressor.  There is no prior record of 
atrial fibrillation noted in his record.

wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to 
distal moderate anterior and ___ wall hypoknesis. 
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis 
(LVEF = 35-40%). Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
mildly depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber size

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ via transfer 
from ___ for surgical management of his coronary 
artery disease. He was worked-up by the cardiac surgical service 
in the usual preoperative manner. He waited for Plavix washout, 
requiring Nitroglycerin drip for his stenosis preop. Bedside 
PFTs were done. He had an episode of Epistaxis on HD# 4. His 
hematocrit was=25 and he was transfused one pack red blood 
cells. His Hep drip was held at that time. 
On HD# 5 he was taken to the operating room and underwent 1. 
Urgent pump assisted coronary artery bypass graft x3: Left 
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, 
saphenous vein graft to diagonal and obtuse  marginal arteries.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein with 
___.  He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred 
to the CVICU for further invasive monitoring. He awoke 
neurologically intact and weaned to extubate. His postop 
hypertension was controlled with Nicardipine drip. He weaned off 
the drip with Hydralazine and Beta-blocker. Statin/ASA and 
diuresis were initiated. All lines and tubes were discontinued 
per protocol withoout incident. On pod#1 he transferred to the 
step down unit for further recovery. Physical Therapy was 
consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility. While on the 
step down unit his rhythm went into rapid atrial fibrillation. 
Initially the rate was difficult to control requiring Amio bolus 
x 2 and drip per protocol along with IV Beta-blocker and 
Diltiazem. Ultimately he converted into normal sinus rhythm. No 
anticoagulation per ___ he went back into AF. His 
home meds were reinstated as tolerated. The remainder of his 
hospital course was essentially unremarkable. He continued 
to progress and was cleared for discharge to home with ___ on 
pod#5. All follow up appointments were advised.

quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF = 65%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve is not 
well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There 
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small 
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with recently-diagnosed 
metastatic poorly-differentiated high-grade neuroendocrine 
carcinoma (likely of pulmonary origin), with bulky 
retroperitoneal/common iliac/mediastinal lymphadenopathy 
concerning for metastatic disease, who was admitted to ___ on 
___ with progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia thought to be at 
least partially related to ___ syndrome from an enlarging 
chest/neck mass, which was treated with external radiotherapy.  
Hospital course was been complicated by hypoxemic respiratory 
failure requiring prolonged mechanical intubation, sepsis ___ 
obstructive pneumonia, acute kidney injury ___ acute tubular 
necrosis, malignant pleural effusions requiring bilateral chest 
tube placement and hemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation. 
Mr. ___ was followed closely by numerous consulting services

from a previously existing umbilical hernia.
Patient was evaluated and urgently taken to the OR with Dr 
___ for  umbilical hernia repair with a diagnosis of 
Cirrhosis and leaking in a necrotic
umbilical hernia.

At the time of surgery there was necrotic umbilical skin at the 
abdominal wall.  The
hernia sac was entered and transected. There were several 
varices present which were  ligated. The umbilicus and hernia 
sac were completely resected, the defect was about 4 cm which 
was primarily closed. Approximately one liter of ascites was 
drained at the time of surgery. He did receive albumin for this 
ascites drainage. 
The patient tolerated the procedure without complication, was 
extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.

Blood cultures were obtained on admission to ED, and a culture 
was sent from the ascites fluid drained at the time of the 
surgery. There was no growth in either specimen.
He was given IV Ceftriaxone while hospitalized, was transitioned 
to PO Cipro for home with a one week course of BID, and then 
daily for prophylaxis

Post operatively, the patient did well. The dressing remained 
clean dry and intact with no ascites drainage noted.
The Foley was removed on the evening of POD 1, and he voided 
without difficulty.

His diet was advanced, and was ultimately placed on a low sodium 
diet, seen by nutrition and recommended for supplements in 
addition to his usual diet.

His abdomen remained fairly flat with no evidence of large 
volume ascites re accumulation.

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Large right rectus sheath hematoma measuring 9 x 5.9 x 8.5 cm 
with evidence  of active extravasation. Given patient's history 
of cirrhosis and portal hypertension and venous collaterals, it 
is unclear whether the source of this hematoma is arterial or 
venous. 
2. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion. 
3. Cirrhotic appearing liver, extensive esophageal, perigastric, 
and 
perisplenic varices, and large volume ascites. 

___
PARACENTESIS DIAG/THERA
IMPRESSION:  
  
Technically successful ultrasound-guided diagnostic and 
therapeutic 
paracentesis removing 0.8 L of serosanguineous ascitic fluid. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis 
who presented to ___ on ___ with the chief complaint of 
abdominal pain; evaluation in the ED by surgery revealed 
localized abdominal pain, with clinical and radiological signs 
of an acute abdomen with concern for an internal hernia. The 
patient was taken to the OR for a lysis of adhesions and relief 
of obstruction due to multiple adhesions into the pelvis causing 
an internal loop obstruction. The patient tolerated the 
procedure well, please refer to the operative report for further 
details. Post-procedure the patient was extubated in PACU due to 
prolonged sedation, which went unremarkably. He did receive 24 
hours of cefazolin after surgery, in addition to 5% albumin for 
a total of 500cc for volume support. 

On POD1: The patient was kept NPO, with a NG tube in place. He 
electrolytes were closely monitored and repleted as necessary. 
His pain was further managed with IV and PO pain medications.

POD2: a NGT clamp trial was performed, and the patient was 
started on glutamine supplementation. His electrolytes were 
continued to be closely monitored and repleted. There was a 
concern for a RUE DVT due to difficult CVL placement in the OR; 
however, a repeat RUE/neck US showed no evidence of a DVT. 

POD3: the patient underwent a KUB, which did not show signs of 
obstruction or ileus. NGT was dc'd, and the patient was kept 
NPO. He electrolytes were repleted as per protocol. His foley 
catheter was removed at mid-night, and the patient voided 
spontaneously.

POD4: the patient complained of a cough with intermittent sputum 
production, he was given a PRN nebulizer therapy and a PA/LAT 
cxr was consistent with clearing of a prior mucous plug. The 
patient was started on a clear liquid diet, and his IVF were 
stopped once he was taking in a good amount PO. His home Lasix 
dose was continued as well. The patient's expected 
post-operative pain and transient electrolyte abnormalities were 
followed and corrected.

POD5: overnight the patient complained of ___ 
erythema, along with fluctuance and increased pain/tenderness. 
An Abd/Pelv CT scan without contrast revealed a large right 
rectus sheath hematoma measuring 9 x 5.9 x 8.5 cm with evidence 
of active extravasation; given those findings, several wound 
staples were removed at bed-side with the plan to take to OR as 
soon as possible. The patient received a ___ in the 
interim due to continuous oozing from his abdominal wound. A 
foley was placed due to urinary retention. The patient was taken 
to the OR and a rectus sheath hematoma was evacuated, and any 
active bleeders were treated with argon beam laser. A wound vac 
was placed in the OR for wound management. Post-op the patient's 
medications were resumed, and he was started on a clear liquid 
diet. 

POD6: the patient tolerated his clear diet well and was advanced 
to a regular diet, while his IVF were dc'd. His diuretics were 
restarted and he was given 1U of FFP due to a high INR and 
anticipation of a paracentesis. The patient's levaquin for 
presumed pneumonia was changed to vanc, cefepime for broader 
coverage; in addition, he underwent a nasal MRSA screen which 
was negative, along with sputum cx which grew commensal flora. 
The patient under paracentesis due to abdominal distention, 
where 0.8L were removed, and cell count was not consistent with 
SBP. The patient received 12.5 grams of albumin for repletion. 

POD7: the patient was restarted on his lactulose, his foley 
dc'd, and a vac placed. 

POD8: the patient was managed for his routine pain control, 
electrolyte repletion, along with ambulation.

POD9: a physical therapy consult was placed, and the patient 
resumed his PO levaquin to complete a 7-day course. 

POD10-11: an occupation therapy consult was placed, and the 
patient was discharged to rehab. 
The patient's vac was changed on ___ its measurements are 
5cmX2cmX1cm deep, and the vac is set on min suction at -75 mmHg

At the time of discharge, the patient was comfortable with the 
discharge plan and recommendations.

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a ___ year old male, with ETOH and Hep C
cirrhosis, child's class B (MELD 16) presenting to the ED with
acute abdominal pain concerning for recurrent bowel obstruction.
Patient is now being seen by Transplant surgery in consultation.

As above, the patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to
both ethanol and Hep C. Currently compensated. Last paracentesis
performed ___ years ago. His surgical history is pertinent for a
prior umbilical repair, and an exploratory laparotomy for a
closed loop obstruction requiring lysis of an internal hernia.
The patient was in his usual state of health until last night
when he developed an acute abdominal pain. He describes the pain
as stabbing in nature and constant. The pain is located in his
right flank. He has had around 10 episodes of bilious emesis.
Denies hematemesis. Last episode of vomiting was this morning at
10:00. He has not felt better after the emesis triggering this 
ED
visit. He describes this pain similar in nature as prior one

Summary: 
---------
Mr ___ is a ___ man with alcoholic and hepatitis C 
cirrhosis who presented with abdominal pain, and was found to 
have a perforated inoperable duodenal and stomach ulcer.  

Active Issues:
--------------
# DUODENAL AND GASTRIC ULCERS with
# ___ GUIDED DRAINAGE OF LESSER SAC COLLECTION:
The patient presented to the ___ Emergency Department with 
abdominal pain. There was evidence of perforated ulcer on both 
CT abdomen and upper GI series (posterior antral leak to lesser 
sac). Initially he was kept NPO with IV hydration and placed on 
broad-spectrum antibiotics with pip-tazo and fluconazole from 
___. 
He underwent EGD on ___ with the following finding: large 
ulcer measuring approximately 5-6cm was seen in the first part 
of the duodenum.  There was likely perforation around the edge 
of the ulcer measuring 2-3cm -This appeared contained. The 
perforation was too large for endoscopic intervention. There was 
also moderate to severe esophagitis in the distal esophagus with 
portal hypertensive gastropathy seen. H. pylori was negative. He 
was put on the maximum dose of PPI.  A NG was in place. 
He underwent exploratory laparotomy by Dr. ___, but 
was found to have a frozen abdomen thus unable to see perforated 
stomach. Postop, he was transferred to the SICU for management 
as he was hypotensive and hematocrit had decreased. He was given 
albumin and 4 units of PRBC. Hct stabilized, but on ___, he 
had brief episode of SVT with rate of 160 without blood pressure 
drop; afib with intermittent RVR that was treated with 
metoprolol IV x 2 with decrease in BP. The patient required 
pressors and amiodarone was started (please see #Afib below). 

He transferred out of the SICU and was started on TPN. Afib was 
managed with metoprolol. Metoprolol dose was increased and he 
was given intermittent doses of Lasix for volume control and 
pulmonary edema seen on CXR. 

His diet was initially advanced to clears then full liquids. 
However, he did not tolerate advancement to a regular diet. He 
experienced a lot of abdominal pain. Diet was changed to just 
sips of clears and pain was managed with a Dilaudid PCA.  His 
diet was eventually changed to tube feeds and then regular diet 
as per an initial goals of care discussion. An abdominal CT 
___ an 8cm loculated fluid collection in lesser 
sac. He then underwent ___ placement of a drain in the 
fluid collection. Microbiology evaluation of the fluid 
collection did not grow any organisms, so antibiotics were 
discontinued on ___.  ___ continued to follow the drain until 
output was < 5cc for 2 consecutive days, at which point the 
drain was pulled.  Diet was advanced slowly for comfort, with 
supplemental nutrition from nasogastric tube feeds.  After a 
goals of care meeting on ___, Pt endorsed a desire to 
transition towards measures that would improve his comfort.  In 
light of this, his NGT was pulled ___ and he was permitted a 
regular PO diet, which he tolerated well. Patient was continued 
on sucralfate for continued gastric coating and comfort.  PPI 
and other unnecessary medicines were held.

# GOALS OF CARE DISCUSSION:
Pt with poor prognosis due to his perforated viscus, surgically 
frozen abdomen, and non-transplant candidacy.  A goals of care 
meeting was held on ___ with the patient and his friend, as 
well as newly-chosen HCP, ___.  At this meeting, Pt 
acknowledged the severity of his illness and endorsed a 
willingness to transition his course more towards 
comfort-focused care.  Medicines that would not contribute to 
his comfort were discontinued.  Unnecessary tubes and lines, 
including his NGT and PICC line, were removed prior to 
discharge.  Patient was discharged to a ___ facility for 
housing and further titration of his care.

# ETOH/HCV CIRRHOSIS with
# ASCITES and
# NEED FOR SBP PPX:
Previously complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, grade 
I esophageal varices.  Pt without significant hepatic 
encephalopathy or large ascites during his hospital stay; he was 
initially put on oral diuretics to minimize the ascites and risk 
of wound dehiscence, but these were held in the setting of 
significant weight loss while on tube feeds and overall hypo- to 
euvolemic appearance on exam.  Patient was continued on Bactrim 
for SBP prophylaxis.  He was continued on lactulose to keep his 
mental status clear.  Given goals of care discussion as above, 
vitamins such as thiamine and multivitamin were discontinued.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:
Had one episode of Afib on ___, for which he was amiodarone 
loaded and started on amio gtt.  He was stable on PO metoprolol 
in-house, though sometimes limited due to soft blood pressures.  
He had a CHADS-VASC of 0.  Given his goals of care discussion at 
discharge, PO metoprolol was discontinued.  Anticoagulation was 
deferred given recent surgery as well as goals of care 
discussion as above.

# NUTRITION:
Initially requiring TPN, then tube feeds by ___.  He 
continued to lose muscle mass despite optimal nutrition on TF's. 
 After goals of care discussion ___, patient was provided with 
a regular diet - which he tolerated well.

intoxicated with BRBPR and hematemesis yesterday. Initially 
stabilized with 2 units pRBCs. hct 24, plt 96, INR 1.8. Alcohol 
level 0.195. GI performed EGD under concious sedation and saw 
fresh blood in stomach and esophagus, banded 3 varices. 
Ocreotide and protonix drips started. RUQ showed only ascites 
and cirrhotic liver, PV not mentioned. After endoscope, started 
having active hematemasis and was then intubated. Repeat EGD saw 
again lots of blood but did not believe varices had new 
bleeding. Injected sodium tetradisusulfate into the varix. GI 
recommended transfer.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female with a right carotid body 
tumor who was admitted to the ___ 
___ on ___. The patient was taken to the endovascular 
suite and underwent angioembolization of her tumor. For details 
of the procedure, please see the surgeon's operative note. Pt 
tolerated the procedure well without complications and was 
brought to the post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. 
She subsequently underwent resection of right carotid body 
tumor, with preservation of the internal and external carotid 
arteries and facial nerve monitoring on ___. After a brief 
stay, pt was transferred to the vascular surgery floor where she 
remained through the rest of the hospitalization.

Post-operatively, she did well without any groin swelling nor 
facial or other neuro deficits. She remained neurologically 
intact throughout her hospitalization.  She had a right JP drain 
below her incision to monitor drainage which initially was 
sanguineous but soon became sero-sanguineous. By POD 4 the 
draining volume had decreased to less than 30mL per day and the 
drain was removed. 

She was able to tolerate a regular diet, get out of bed and 
ambulate without assistance, void without issues, and pain was 
controlled on oral medications alone. She was deemed ready for 
discharge, and was given the appropriate discharge and follow-up 
instructions.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a healthy ___ year-old male who presented with 
back pain and chest pain following a crossfit work-out and was 
found to have a dissection of the abdominal aorta in addition to 
new q waves on EKG and a mildly elevated troponin. The patient 
reports that he had a strenuous work-out the morning of 
admission. At home, shortly following the work-out, he 
experienced acute onset back pain across his back below the 
clavicle. This was associated with a cold sweat. The pain did 
not subside and when the patient tried to climb his stairs at 
home, he felt extremely week and thus presented to the ___ at 
___. Upon presentation his back pain began to subside 
but he did begin to experience some mild central chest pain. 

At the ___, he was hemodynamically stable. An EKG was 
obtained which demonstrated new inferior q waves and a troponin 
was measured at 0.04. A CTA was obtained which demonstrated an 
abdominal aortic dissection of the infrarenal aorta. He was 
therefore transferred to ___ for further care. 

Here CT repeated â still no ascending dissection.  Overnight 
echocardiogram poor quality, no obvious WMA.  This morningâs 
echo showed slight inferior HK.  Cardiac biomarkers rising and 
pt noted to have Q waves with slight STEs inferiorly. 

He went to cath and was found to have a RCA lesion. He had a 
thrombectomy with no stent and has a 50% residual distal RCA 
stenosis. Admitted to the CCU for further monitoring.

Vitals on transfer were: T  98.2, HR 63, BP 123/71, RR 21, 99% 
RA.

On the floor, patient reports that he feels ""great"" with no 
chest pain, back pain, shoulder pain or SOB. Only complaint is 
of mild lower abdominal dull pain.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You came to the hospital because you were having chest pain. We 
found that you were having a heart attack and we broke down a 
clot from one of your hearts blood vessels to treat that. Other 
imaging found that the wall of your large blood vessel, the 
aorta had formed a slit called a dissection. The vascular 
surgeons and did not think you needed to have a surgical repair 
at this time. It will be very important for you to keep good 
control of your blood pressure, and follow-up with the vascular 
surgeons, your PCP, and your new cardiologist (Drs. ___ 
and ___.  

Should you have any chest pain, please use the nitroglycerin 
pills we have prescribed for you. Take up to three pills, spaced 
5 minutes apart. If the pain does not go away after this, call 
___. If your pain does go away, call either Dr. ___ Dr. 
___ an appointment.

Finally, we have started you on several new medications because 
of your heart attack. These are very important, and must be 
taken every day. They are:

1) Ticagrelor (Brillinta) 90 mg twice a day. This will be 
continued for at least 3 months, and potentially as long as 9 
months. The duration of this will be decided in follow-up 
appointments with Dr. ___
2) Aspirin 81 mg daily, likely for the forseeable future
3) Metoprolol succinate 12.5 mg daily, on an ongoing basis
4) Atorvastatin 80 mg daily, on an ongoing basis

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

SURGERY DISCHARGE SUMMARY (___)
Ms. ___ was transferred to the ___ Surgical Service for 
further management. She was made NPO with IV fluids, and 
continued on IV Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Micafungin. 
Neuro: The patient received PO dilaudid with good effect and 
adequate pain control. When tolerating PO patient was 
transitioned to PO pain medication. Chronic pain service was 
consulted in order to optimize patient's pain control and their 
recommendations were followed. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Cardiac Echo 
was obtained and demonstrated normal global and regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction, borderline right ventricular 
systolic function (see report for details). 
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: Initially upon transfer patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids and TPN. On ___ a Dobhoff nasogastric tube was placed at 
the bedside, which was then advanced post-pyloric by radiology. 
Tube feeds were then initiated and titrated up to goal rate, 
which she tolerated. TPN was discontinued when tube feeds were 
at goal. She was also advanced to clear liquids which she 
tolerated. On ___ her 8French drain in the cyst was upsized by 
interventional radiology to a 20 ___ drain. Drain output was 
closely monitored. Patient's intake and output were closely 
monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  
Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when 
necessary.
ID: The patient's white blood count was monitored and continued 
to trend downward throughout her hospital course. The infectious 
disease service continued to follow. Vanc and Zosyn were 
discontinued on ___ per their recommendations after cyst 
cultures were positive only for budding yeast. On ___ her 
Micafungin was also discontinued due to the continued decreasing 
white blood cell count and the fact that her drain was putting 
out minimal purulent drainage. The patient remained afebrile 
with mild elevated WBC prior discharge. WBC will be continued to 
follow as outpatient. ID was contacted prior patient discharge, 
and ID agreed with the plan to discharge without antibiotics 
treatment. PICC line was removed prior discharge.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. Patient was 
discharged on sliding scale insulin.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required. 
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating TF at goal 
and clears, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was 
well controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ from clinic where she had presented with left abdominal 
pain and tachycardia. Her drain had been removed in clinic and 
silver nitrate was applied due to some bloody drainage at the 
site. On admission, she was made NPO, put on IV pain medication, 
and received IV fluid hydration. CT scan of her abdomen showed 
an interval decrease in size of a prior peripancreatic fluid 
collection with question of superinfection of the collection. CT 
also showed question of a new splenic infarct, a high density in 
the subcutaneous tissue of the right posterolateral drain tract 
(which was correlated with the application of silver nitrate at 
that site), and a destructive appearing right iliac lucency 
concerning for a metastatic focus (given history of breast 
cancer). Infectious work up was done that was unremarkable - 
chest x-ray showed mild atelectasis and urinalaysis was 
negative. Her labs were also within normal limits with no 
leukocytosis. 
 
On HD2, the patient showed improvement in her abdominal pain and 
was advanced to a regular diet, which she tolerated well with no 
nausea and vomiting. Her home medications were restarted, and 
she was transitioned to PO pain control. Her wound remained 
covered, and her ostomy was viable. 
 
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. We discussed with her the CT finding of possible 
metastatic disease for which she was follow up with oncology. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

DIAGNOSTICS AND IMAGING
RUQ w/ Doppler ___: 
IMPRESSION:  
Cirrhotic appearing liver with large ascites and splenomegaly.  
No suspicious masses.  Patent hepatic vasculature. 
Cholelithiasis. 

Renal US ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No evidence of hydronephrosis.   
2.  Cirrhosis with large amount of intra-abdominal ascites. 

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the study of ___, there are again low 
lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the 
heart.  Continued increased opacification at the left base, 
consistent with pleural effusion and compressive basilar 
atelectasis.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could 
reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The ___ 
tube appears unchanged

CT A/P ___. 24 cm right retroperitoneal hematoma secondary to a right 
common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm measuring 2.2 cm with a 
neck of 0.2 cm and another component of the pseudoaneurysm just 
superiorly measuring 3 cm. 
2. Cirrhosis, ascites and splenomegaly. 
3. Cholelithiasis. 
4. Moderate right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis. 

___ Arteriogram
1. Punctate foci of active extravasation from the right L3 and 
L4 lumbar 
arteries, treated with Gelfoam and coil embolization, with good 
angiographic result. 
2. The right lateral circumflex artery was in proximity to the 
known area of bleeding, and was Gel-Foam and coil embolized, 
with good angiographic result. 
3. The previously identified right common femoral artery 
pseudoaneurysm 
remains thrombosed, with a tiny area (2-3 mm) of residual 
pseudoaneurysm, too small to treat.  This will likely thrombose 
on its own. 
4. A small 4 mm pseudoaneurysm identified arising from the left 
SFA on left CFA angiography at the site of the arterial pressure 
line entry was too small to treat, and appeared thrombosed with 
ultrasound at the conclusion of the case. 

___ CT A/P
IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  Stable size of large right retroperitoneal hematoma status 
post coil 
embolization of right lumbar arteries and right lateral 
circumflex artery.  No evidence of active extravasation. 
2.  Cirrhosis with sequelae of portal hypertension including 
splenomegaly, 
ascites and perigastric varices. 
3.  No drainable fluid collection identified.  No evidence of 
bowel ischemia. 
4.  Tiny 6 mm pseudoaneurysm arising from the left superficial 
femoral artery just distal to its origin.  The pseudoaneurysm is 
superior to the site of active extravasation seen on ___. 

___ CT Chest
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent 
consolidation, which 
appears to be predominantly atelectasis.  A component of 
infection may also be present.

___ CT Head
1. Severely motion limited examination demonstrating no acute 
large 
intracranial abnormality. 
2. Fluid in the posterior nasopharynx and mastoid air cells 
bilaterally.

___ CT A/P
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large right retroperitoneal hematoma is similar in appearance 
to prior 
examination given redistribution.  No evidence of active bleed. 
2. No findings to suggest infection in the abdomen or pelvis. 

___ CT Chest
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of active intrathoracic infection or malignancy. 
Small bilateral effusions with persistent left left lower lobe 
collapse and right basal atelectasis with increasing 
endobronchial secretions in the lower lobes. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old with ___ Class C cirrhosis secondary to NASH 
presenting from clinic with volume overload, sarcopenia, and 
question of possible TIPS for refractory ascites.

FLOOR COURSE:
Patient was admitted with diuretic refractory ascites. He was 
admitted for paracenteses and evaluation for TIPS and future 
transplant. The transplant team made the initial decision that 
the patient is not a TIPS or transplant candidate because of 
severe malnutrition, and goal became to improve nutritional 
status and then proceed.

The patient's renal function began to worsen, and workup was 
consistent with hepatorenal syndrome. Nephrology was consulted, 
and agreed with HRS as the diagnosis, and he was started on 
midodrine, octreotide and daily albumin. As his renal failure 
progressed, he required dialysis and had a dialysis line placed 
___. His worsening renal function led to the decision to 
expedite his transplant eligibility. Because he has a history of 
CAD and is s/p 2 stents from ___, he had to undergo a cardiac 
catheterization for evaluation of CAD and transplant 
eligibility. He went for cardiac cath on ___, which found no 
interventional lesions. However, the day after the procedure he 
developed a retroperitoneal bleed, which led to transfer to the 
ICU.

MICU COURSE:

# Shock: Initially secondary to hemorrhagic shock due to 
retroperitoneal bleed requiring massive transfusion protocol on 
arrival to the MICU. He was resuscitated though subsequently had 
ongoing septic shock physiology requiring pressor support. 
Etiology of septic shock was secondary to new infections 
including serratia UTI, E.coli bacteremia, MSSA VAP. Despite 
completing a course of antibiotics (Vanc/Meropenem) for all of 
these infections by ___ he had a persistent and rising 
leukocytosis. Infectious disease was consulted for assistance 
with workup and management. Micafungin was added for empiric 
fungal coverage. His HD line (placed in the setting of renal 
failure as below) was removed. Pus was noted around the 
insertion site, suggesting a line infection as a possible 
contributing source. Blood cultures, however, remained negative. 
Peritoneal fluid was also not suggestive of infection. Note is 
made of peritoneal fluid from ___, which appears inflammatory, 
despite correction for RBC count. Cultures were negative, 
however and subsequent pleural fluid did not suggest spontaneous 
or secondary bacterial peritonitis.  Alternative etiology 
potentially secondary to persisent gut translocation into the 
peritoneal space. His leukocytosis downtrended without a clear 
source of ongoing infection. 

# Respiratory failure: Mr. ___ was initially intubated in the 
setting of hemorrhagic shock and metabolic acidosis. His course 
was then complicated by MSSA VAP. After correction of metabolic 
acidosis he remained intubated in the setting of altered mental 
status, volume overload, and impaired lung dynamics in the 
setting of ascites. Yet, despite clearing of his mental status, 
improvement of volume status with HD, and large volume 
paracenteses it was not possible to wean him off of the 
ventilator. He remained intubated for more than two weeks with a 
likely contribution from respiratory muscle weakness in the 
setting of prolonged intubation. He had ongoing thick secretions 
requiring repeated bronchoscopies for clearance of mucous 
plugging and LLL collapse. Tracheostomy was discussed with the 
patient and family. The patient clearly indicated that he did 
not want a tracheostomy, nor did he want to remain intubated. 
Rather, he made it clear that he wanted to be extubated to 
comfort care. He was extubated on the evening of ___ and 
passed within a few hours. Family was at bedside. 

# Renal failure: Mr. ___ was noted to have progressively 
worsening renal function prior to MICU transfer, consistent with 
hepatorenal syndrome. He was started on midodrine and octreotide 
as well as albumin. His renal failure progressed requiring 
dialysis and a dialysis line was placed ___. He continued on 
CVVH while in the ICU and was ultimately transitioned to 
intermittent HD. His HD line was removed as noted above in the 
setting of persistent leukocytosis for a line holiday. A 
temporary line was replaced given ongoing dialysis needs. He 
required pressors in the ICU in order to tolerate fluid removal 
with HD.  
 
# MSSA pneumonia: Noted to have MSSA pneumonia from sputum 
culture on ___. He was initially treated with Vancomycin 
pending sensitivities. However, he was continued on Vancomycin 
despite penicillin sensitivity in order to prevent inducible 
serratia resistance in the setting of serratia UTI, as below. He 
completed a course of antibiotics on ___, though antibiotics 
were continued as noted above in the setting of ongoing 
leukocytosis. 

# E.coli bacteremia: E.coli noted on blood culture on ___. He 
was initially treated with Meropenem for GNR bacteremia and 
completed a 2 week course of meropenem on ___, though 
antibiotics were continued in the setting of persistent 
leukocytosis as above and concern for ongoing gut translocation. 


# Serratia UTI: Noted on urine culture on ___. He was treated 
with a course of meropenem.

# Atrial flutter/fib: MICU course was complicated by recurrent 
episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter. This initially 
occurred in the setting of volume removal with CVVH and 
responded well to doses of metoprolol or diltiazem. He developed 
atrial fibrillation with hypotension requiring pressors later in 
his ICU course during bronchoscopy, requiring amiodarone. He was 
continued on amiodarone until his he was transitioned to comfort 
measures. 

# Ileus: Mr. ___ malnutrition was noted while he was on the 
floor and prior to MICU transfer. After intubation an NGT was 
placed and tube feeds were initiated. He had high residuals that 
precluded goal tube feeding. CT A/P did not reveal obstructive 
pathology. Concern for potential peritonitis causing ileus, 
though ileus persisted despite negative peritoneal cultures. 
Ileus did not improve with reglan. He was started on TPN. A 
dophoff was placed, advanced post-pyloric by ___. 

# Decompensated Cirrhosis: Mr. ___ had worsening liver failure 
with rising bilirubin and MELD score throughout his hospital 
stay in the setting of multiple complications as noted below. 
Also with renal failure requiring HD. MICU team and liver 
attending had ongoing family meetings regarding potential for 
liver/kidney transplant. As his hospital course progressed it 
became increasingly clear that he would not recover to be well 
enough for a transplant. His family struggled to come to terms 
with this. Ultimately he indicated that he wanted to be 
extubated to CMO and passed within a few hours. Family was at 
bedside.

IMAGING: 
___ CXR: The lung apices are not depicted. NG tube ends in 
the gastric antrum in appropriate position. The lungs are clear, 
the cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal. There is 
no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. Partially visualized 
abdomen shows normal bowel gas pattern. 

EGD ___:
Esophagitis in the lower third of the esophagus
Small hiatal hernia
Friability and erythema in the antrum and stomach body 
compatible with gastritis
Ulcer in the pylorus
Ulcers in the duodenal bulb
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 
Recommendations: Prilosec 40mg BID
Advance diet as tolerated. Avoid NSAIDs. Serial hcts. Active 
type and cross. GI bleeding is unlikely the cause of the 
patient's current hypotensive episodes and warrents further 
investigation for a possible infectious cause. Given the clear 
history of NSAID use, follow up egd is not required but would 
check a h pylori serology and treat if positive. Would need a 
test of cure 4 weeks post h pylori serology as well. 

.
___ CTA chest: 
1. No PE.  
2. Mild pulmonary edema. 
3. Upper lobe peribronchovascular airspace filling could be 
edema or a manifestation of more severe airspace abnormality in 
the lower lungs, mostly consolidation, partially atelectasis, 
due to aspiration, multifocal 
pneumonia, or less likely hemorrhage. In the setting of a recent 
transfusions, transfusion reaction may be contributory.    
4. Esophageal wall thickening, with diffuse infiltration of the 
mediastinal fat which may reflect inflammatory change or 
confluent lymphadenopathy, though the progression from normal 
mediastinal contours on ___ favors a rapidly evolving 
inflammatory process. There is no finding to suggest esophageal 
perforation. 
.
___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a 
massive increase in extent and severity of multifocal pneumonia. 
The resulting very widespread parenchymal opacities are more 
extensive on the right than on the left and show multiple air 
bronchograms. In addition, retrocardiac atelectasis has newly 
appeared, and there is a small right pleural effusion. The 
opacities are better displayed on the CTA examination, performed 
yesterday at 9:41 p.m. Moderate cardiomegaly. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with no known medical history who presented 
with subjective fevers, abdominal pain, and hematemesis and 
developed hypoxic respiratory failure. Clinical picture likely 
consistent with an initial gastroenteritis with emesis likely 
leading to aspiration pneumonia and hematemesis.

# Hematemesis: EGD revealed mild esophagitis, a non-bleeding 7mm 
ulcer in the pylorus, and several superficial non-bleeding 
ulcers ranging in size from 3mm to 5mm in the duodenal bulb. 
This was likely due to aspirin use and recurrent emesis. H. 
pylori antibody is negative. Her HCT continued to rise and she 
was transitioned from a pantoprazole gtt to pantoprazole 40mg PO 
Q12h.   

# Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Patient developed fevers and 
new hypoxia on ___. She was empirically treated for pneumonia 
with ceftriaxone. CT chest showed likely multifocal pneumonia 
which was possible due to aspiration. Given these findings, 
antibiotics were broadened to vanc/levo/flagyl and ID was 
consulted. The vanc was discontinued on ___ and the patient was 
discharged with PO levo and flagyl for likely aspiration 
pneumonia. Her pulmonary status improved significantly during 
hosptialization and she was satting 100% on RA at discharge.

# Volume overload: the patient received over 12L of IV fluids in 
the ICU in the setting of hypotension (BP 80/40s with fever, 
mottled legs, likely sepsis with pulmonary source). After pt 
stabalized, she was gently diuresed.

# Diarrhea/Abdominal Pain: Likely viral gastroenteritis as this 
resolved during the hospitalization. Stool cultures, including C 
diff, were negative.

# Tick Bite: Recent tick bite removed quickly. Lyme serologies 
were negative and smear was negative for babesiosis although   
ANAPLASMA PHAGOCYTOPHILUM was negative.
.  
# Transaminitis: Very mild transaminitis (50s). No RUQ pain, no 
hyperbilirubinemia. Likely related to viral 
gastroenteritis/acute infectious process. 

Transitional issues/INcidental radiographic findings.
-Pt will require primary care follow up: has not seen a PCP ___ 
___ years. Would follow LFT's as well. 
-Pt has recently decided to stop smoking. Outpatient support 
should be provided to support this goal.
-Pt still mildly volume overload at discharge. She was 
mobilizing and self-diuresing effectively and will follow up 
with PCP closely to see if she would benefit from lasix.
-___ WAS NOTED TO HAVE ESOPHAGEAL WALL THICKENING ON CT WITH 
CONFLUENT LYMPHADENOPATHY THAT FAVORED AN INFLAMMATORY PROCESS. 
This will likely require further work up

Pulmonary Edema

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were treated in the hospital for pneumonia and vomitting up 
of blood clots that likely developed because of vomitting, 
diarrhea, and fevers (possibly due to a stomach flu) as well as 
high doses of aspirin that worsened your stomach and small 
intestine ulcers. 

It is important that you complete the course of antibiotics for 
treatment of your pneumonia. Please take Levofloxacin 750 mg by 
mouth daily and metronidazole 500 mg by mouth every 8 hours for 
six more days.

As you know, you were given many liters of fluids through your 
veins while you were in the intensive care unit because you were 
so sick. You will continue to urinate out this fluid within the 
next several days.

Because you vomitted blood, we took a look at your esophagus, 
stomach, and upper small intestines with a camera. We saw that 
you have an ulcer in your stomach and several ulcers of your 
upper small intestine. To help treat your ulcers, it is 
important that you start to take Prilosec (omeprazole) 40mg 
twice a day. It is also important that you avoid all 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, 
alleve, and aspirin. You may take tylenol.

You developed new diarrhea in the hospital. This is most likely 
likely due to antibiotics and should resolve as your gut flora 
return. You can take yogurt or lactobacillus supplements to 
accelerate this process. If your diarrhea gets worse or you 
develop any fevers, please see your doctor.

Finally, it is important that you begin to see a primary care 
doctor regularly. Please follow-up regarding this 
hospitalization with ___ NP (see appointment below). At 
that time, you will also be set up with a primary care doctor.

We have made the following changes to your medications:
START Levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth daily and metronidazole 500 
mg by mouth every 8 hours for six more days.
START Pantoprazole 40mg by mouth twice a day

pressure control. On ___, patient was started on labetalol gtt 
for better HR and BP control, and this was transitioned to po 
Lopressor and labetalol gtt was discontinued. Otherwise, patient 
was doing well, tolerating regular diet. Ortho recommended 50% 
weight bearing on right leg and full wt bearing on the left leg. 
The patient was transferred to the floor on ___. 

Following transfer to the Trauma floor she continued to make

3. Left rib fractures ___. Right first rib fracture

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
* You were admitted to the hospital after your car accident with 
multiple injuries including a broken right leg, rib fractures 
and a small tear in your aorta which sealed over.

* Your orthopedic surgery went well and your weight bearing 
status on the right leg is partial weight bearing with crutches. 
 The ___ will take your staples out.

* Your injury caused left rib fractures ___ and the right first 
rib which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to 
take shallow breaths because of the pain.
 
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay 
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep 
breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the 
dose and notify your physician.
 
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to 
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing 
and deep breathing.
 
*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
*  Do NOT smoke

* The aortic dissection was noted on your initial CT scan.  You 
need to have good blood pressure control and also must stay on a 
blood thinner called Coumadin.  You will need to have your blood 
tested frequently in the beginning of therapy but after you are 
regulated it should be once a month.  Maintain safety 
precautions while on Coumadin so that you don't bleed.  Be 
careful with sharp objects. Shave your legs with an electric 
razor to prevent cuts that will bleed excessively. Do not use 
ibuprofen or any product with Ibuprofen in it as it can increase 
your bleeding tendency.

 * Dr. ___ will regulate your Coumadin dose.
 
* Your blood sugars have been on the high side since your 
admission and you should talk to your PCP about further testing 
for diabetes.

*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs ( crepitus ), chest pain, or increased leg 
pain.

history who was found to have a heart murmur on his annual
physical exam. An echocardiogram demonstrated severe MR with
preserved biventricular function. He denies any dyspnea on
exertion, fatigue, palpitations, orthopnea or syncopal episodes.
As early intervention can increase the odds of a repair, he has
been referred for surgical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
Intra-op TEE ___
Conclusions  
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. 

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 

No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. 

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened and redundant. 
Atrialization of the posterior leaflet insertion is seen. There 
is prolapse of all three scallops of the posterior mitral 
leaflets with the p2 scallop being most significantly affected. 
The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt. There is both a 
central and eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of MR. ___ 
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the 
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be 
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). 

Dr ___ was notifed of findings in person at time of study. 

POST-CPB:
The anterior mitral leaflet now spans the entire mitral annulus 
and the posterior leaflet can be minimally seen, consistent with 
mitral valve repair. A mitral annular ring is seen. There is no 
residual MR.

___ systolic function remain preserved. Other valvular 
function remains unchanged.

There is no evidence of dissection.

requirement resolved and he was discharged with close follow-up. 
 

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============

# Sepsis and Community Acquired Pneumonia:  Mr. ___ 
presented with tachycardia, temp to 104, and multifocal 
opacities seen on CXR.  He was started on ceftriaxone and 
levofloxacin in accordance to ___ guidelines for community 
acquired pneumonia.  Respiratory viral panel negative, 
legionella negative, strep pneumo antigen negative, and cultures 
were unrevealing.  Pt. grew GPCs in clusters in blood ___ 
bottles) which raised concern for possible MRSA bacteremia from 
MRSA pneumonia.  Pt. has negative MRSA swab and without known 
MRSA risk factors.  TTE was negative for evidence of 
endocarditis and surveillance blood cultures were negative.  
Oxygen requirement had resolved by day 2 of admission and he was 
transferred to the floor.  He was transitioned to levofloxacin 
to complete his course of antibiotics.

# Chest Pain:  Pt. complained of left sided sharp chest pain 
made worse with coughing and deep breathing.  Most likely 
pleuritic chest pain from underlying inflammatory pleuritis from 
pneumonia.  Cardiac enzymes neg x2 making cardiac ischemia less 
likely.  No ischemic changes or other notable changes seen on 
ECG.  TTE done on ___ and was grossly normal with LVEF 60-65%.

# Abdominal Distension:  Initially, pt. presented with diarrhea, 
CDiff negative.  Continued to complain of abdominal distension.  
KUB showed multiple air filled loops of bowel without air fluid 
levels consistent with possible ileus.  Pt. continued to 
complain of minimal flatus, abdominal distension made worse with 
consuming POs, and minimal BMs.  Slowly, he began to tolerate PO 
intake.  At time of discharge, pt. was tolerating full liquids 
without issue.  He was encouraged to advance his diet as 
tolerated.  

# Anemia:  Patient with downtrending Hct throughout this 
admission. Initial and repeat DIC labs returned negative.  Most 
likely etiology ___ bone marrow suppression due to acute illness 
with possible suppression ___ medication effect. No signs of 
active bleeding.

# ___:  Pt. with evidence ___ on admission.  Likely pre-renal 
etiology in the setting of pneumonia and sepsis.  With IVF, pt's 
creatinine returned to baseline and ___ resolved.

CHRONIC ISSUES

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for surgical 
management of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in 
the usual preoperative manner. A radial duplex ultrasound was 
obtained as a radial artery graft was desired given his younger 
age. This revealed significant califications of the bilateral 
radial arteries and thus the decision was made not to use a 
radial artery for conduit.

 On ___, Mr. ___ was taken to the Operating Room where he 
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to five vessels. As 
the greater saphenous vein was very small in the left leg, an 
extra length was harvested from his right thigh. Please see 
operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the 
Intensive Care Unit for monitoring. Over the next several hours, 
he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He was 
transfused a unit of red blood cells for postoperative anemia. 
He remained in atrial fibrillation which was treated with 
Amiodarone. On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the 
step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed 
towards his preoperative weight. The Physical Therapy service 
was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and 
mobility.  

Anti-coagulation was initiated with Coumadin for atrial 
fibrillation.  He was extremely sensitive to dosing and his INR 
rose to 5.2, nec3essitating an extra hospital day as the 
Coumadin was held and the INR fell to 3.  Arrangements were made 
for his anticoagulation to be managed by his primary care 
physician.  Follwoup appointments were given and medications and 
restrictions discussed.

He had converted to sinus rhythm at discharge and Amiodarone 
will be tapered over the next 4 weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ F with h/o CAD, severe aortic stenosis, COPD on 2 L NC, ESRD 
on HD MWF, hypothyroidism, chronic pain transferred from ___ 
___ for new onset afib. 

#New onset Afib - various potential etiologies were considered 
for the patient's Afib, including infection, ischemia, CHF, 
thyroid dysfunction. TSH  was 4.7 and FT4 at 4.7. Patient was 
started on metoprolol tartrate 6.25 mg BID and patient was not 
started on anticoagulation. ECHO revealed mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal left ventricular cavity and 
mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). There 
were No masses or thrombi seen in the left ventricle. The 
patient was in SR with Metoprolol 6.25 mg BID and was discharged 
on ___ with 25 mg Metoprolol succinate daily. ___ Afib was 
thought likely ___ infection (right lobe PNA) for which we 
treated with an 8-day course of levofloxacin.

#Right infrahilar opacity - the patient had a CXR showing a 
questionable right-sided PNA at an OSH for which she received a 
dose of CTX and levofloxacin. Given persisting right infrahilar 
opacity on CXR here, the patient was continued on a 
renally-dosed 8-day course of levofloxacin (500 mg Q48H) for 
community acquired PNA. The patient was afebrile without 
productive cough during ___ admission, though she did report 
mild shortness of breath during the first morning of ___ 
hospital stay that was alleviated with albuterol. 

#Elevated troponin level - the patient presented with elevated 
troponin to 0.33 and CKMB 12. There was no overt ischemic 
changes on EKG, and the patient had a known h/o LBBB. Though 
troponin levels increased from 0.33 --> 0.46 --> 1.03 during the 
___ hospital stay, the patient had no CP during ___ 
admission, and elevated troponin's were thought to be likely ___ 
ESRD. 

#ESRD - patient had HD on ___ and ___ during ___ 
hospital stay. 

#COPD - patient was continued on oxygen and albuterol prn 

#Hypothyroidism - patient was continued on home synthroid 

#Chronic pain - patient reported being on methadone, has

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, ESRD on HD, paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation, and PPM for LBBB/syncope presents following 
acute LOC while at HD with pulselessness. Patient underwent 
___ minutes of CPR (no epi or defibrillation per ED report) 
before ROSC was achieved. Initial rhythm during the event is 
unclear. Of note, she was in dialysis for 1 hour and only 140 cc 
were removed prior to event. Patient was subsequently 
transferred to ___ where she was started on heparin gtt 
for possible NSTEMI given ST depressions on EKG and initial 
troponin of 0.08. While at A-J, SBP dropped to 35 and patient 
went into rapid atrial fibrillation. 12-lead EKG showed a left 
bundle branch block, which she is known to have and occurs 
intermittently. Patient was subsequently cardioverted and 
received 2 L NS and IV digoxin, prior to returning to NSR
 
At A-J, she underwent CT angiogram which did not show aortic 
dissection or pulmonary embolus. Patient was awake and talking 
and denied CP or SOB, though she endorsed significant ongoing 
back pain, which has been a chronic issue. BP subsequently 
improved with initiation of Levophed. Cardiology was consulted 
due to concern for posterior STEMI given EKG findings; posterior 
MI was felt to be unlikely and ischemic findings were thought to 
be ___ hypotension and severe AS. She was subsequently 
transferred to ___ for CVVHD and further management.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She endorses back pain. She endorses dyspnea 
on exertion prior to HD sessions, which is relieved following 
HD. Otherwise review of systems was negative.

IMAGING
=======

CATH:
Impressions:
1. Moderate three vessel CAD.
2. Preserved cardiac ouput.
3. Elevated left sided filling pressure with prominent V waves.

ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 25%) secondary 
to akinesis of the inferior wall, hypokinesis of the posterior 
wall, and pacing-induced dyssynchrony. Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade 
III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The 
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free 
wall function. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is 
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area = 0.5 cm2). No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are severely 
thickened/deformed. There is severe mitral annular 
calcification. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean 
gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Severe 
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

DISCHARGE LABS:
Patient died. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, ESRD on HD, paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation, and PPM for LBBB/syncope who presents 
following cardiac arrest, transferred to ___ for further 
management of hypotension associated with HD sessions and for 
post cardiac arrest care.

#Goals of care. Given worsening clinical condition over the 
course of the hospital stay and inability to tolerate HD with 
necessity of pressors, discussions about patients outcome were 
ongoing with her daughter/HCP ___. Confirmed with daughter 
that quality of life is of great importance to the patient. 
Patient was eventually on higher O2 requirements, two pressors, 
and became increasingly somnolent. Patient's daughter agreed 
that they should focus on her comfort. She was transitioned to 
CMO on ___ and died later in the day on ___. For 
hospital course by problem see below.

#s/p cardiac arrest
#Elevated lactate
#Leukocytosis: Patient transferred to ___ after pulselessness, 
requiring ___ minutes of CPR before achieving ROSC. Etiology 
of arrest remained unclear. Most likely I/s/o low flow state due 
to hypotension during HD and severe AS ___ 0.8 in ___. 
Etiology unlikely to be ___ arrhythmia (PPM interrogation with 
longest AF episode to be 5 seconds). CTA negative for PE. 

#Hypotension. was likely multifactorial, related to severe AS, 
MR, and Afib iso moderate to diffuse CAD. Patient was difficult 
to wean from pressors, and difficult to manage AS, MR, and Afib 
effectively given that patient is not candidate for CABG.  
Pressor requirement increased over course and included midodrine 
10mg TID.

#NSTEMI: OSH EKG with ST depressions prominent in V2-V4, with 
elevated troponins to 0.08, in the setting of pulseless arrest, 
concerning for likely type II NSTEMI in the setting of low flow 
state from severe AS and hypotension with HD. Trop peaked at 
7.31 and MB peaked at 506.  TTE shows preserved LVEF >55%, 
similar severe AS, new severe MR, elevated pulmonary/right sided 
pressures. Cath ___ showed moderate to diffuse dz, non-critical 
lesions.

#Severe AS: AS likely contributing to pulselessness and LOC. TTE 
in ___ with ___ 0.8 and elevated peak velocity/peak 
gradient. She had RHC in preparation for TAVR, but patient 
decompensated. See above. 
                                                                 
                    
#Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: s/p cardioversion prior to 
admission. Onset noted in ___ in the setting of PNA, for 
which she was started on Metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily. 
CHA2DS2-VASc 5. Anticoagulation was deferred during previous 
admission after risks/benefits discussion. She was placed on AC 
here and was loaded with amio and digoxin with some benefit.

#Mixed systolic, diastolic HF: LVEF 45-50% on TTE in ___. 
BNP elevated to 32,000. Pt tried to have HD as above for fluid 
removal and did not tolerate as above.

#Positive blood cultures: Pt w/ ___ bottles growing GPC in pairs 
and clusters. Afebrile, but w/slight leukocytosis. ___ blood 
cx- ___ coag-neg Staph<10,000, and started empiric vanc ___ and 
removed femoral line and replaced w/IJ. Repeat cx- NGTD >48hrs 
and empiric vanc was discontinued.

IMAGING
===================
___ LENIs
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins.

___ CT Chest w and wout
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic 
abnormality. 
2.  Multiple pulmonary nodules, the largest of which measures 7 
mm.  If 
clinically indicated, follow-up chest CT is suggested at ___ 
months.  If there 
is no change, a second follow-up in ___ months and then at 24 
months is 
recommended if there is no change. 
3.  Dilated main pulmonary artery likely reflective of pulmonary 
arterial 
hypertension. 
4.  Markedly enlarged thyroid gland with mediastinal extension 
and severe 
narrowing of the trachea. 
5.  Mild centrilobular emphysema. 

CXR ___
1. Moderate pulmonary congestion and mild interstitial edema is 
increased, 
moderate right pleural effusion is new, and moderate left 
basilar atelectasis is increased since ___, consistent 
with acute CHF exacerbation. Large goiter, unchanged. 

Ankle XR ___
FINDINGS:  
No acute fracture or dislocation is detected about the left 
ankle.  There is minimal spurring about the distal tibia, but no 
other evidence of tibiotalar joint osteoarthritis.  The mortise 
joint is congruent, without talar dome OCD. There is prominent 
enthesophytic spurring along the posterior and inferior 
calcaneus.  An ovoid density projects inferior to the fibula 
measures 5 mm, of unclear etiology, potentially sequelae of 
prior trauma.  Differential diagnosis could include a early 
left, focus hydroxyapatite, or calcified lymph node.  No 
suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.  Vascular 
calcifications are noted. 

CT abdomen ___
 
1. No evidence of malignancy or metastatic disease within the 
abdomen or 
pelvis although residual high-density oral contrast and 
associated artifact moderately limits evaluation of the large 
bowel and pelvis. 
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. 
3. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary dilation, which may 
represent 
previous gallstone passage. 
4. Extensive atherosclerosis and infrarenal abdominal aortic 
ectasia measuring maximally 31 mm. 
5. Diverticulosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with atrial fibrillation on warfarin, PE, CKD III, PVD, 
multinodular goiter s/p biopsy w/ possible follicular neoplasm 
in ___ who was sent to ___ ED after being found to have L 
jugular and subclavian venous thrombosis despite therapeutic INR 
on warfarin. 

#Hypoxemia and Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure (Acute on 
Chronic):
Patient w/new O2 requirement, hx of OSA, and ABG was consistent 
with acute on chronic respiratory failure. Likely the patient's 
stenosis of her airway from large goiter contributing. Also, may 
have undiagnosed COPD given emphysematous changes on her CT scan 
along with untreated OSA. Her elevated bicarbonate is suggestive 
of a chronic process. She was transferred to the ICU on ___ 
for monitoring w/continuous O2 (88-92%) due to concerns about 
airway compression and increasing oxygen requirement shortly 
after her admission. ENT was consulted on ___ for evaluation 
of any airway compromise and did not feel that any intervention 
was warranted. She did not demonstrate any respiratory distress 
at any time during her hospital stay. She was transferred to the 
floor on the ___ and had continuous O2 monitoring. She also 
continued to use BiPap with good effect at night. Bipap settings 
were: EPAP 5 IPAP 15 O2 flow: 6

#LUE DVTs: Patient w/new onset DVTs despite therapeutic 
warfarin. This is concerning for a coagulopathy. It is unclear 
if this is inherited or acquired perhaps in the setting of 
malignancy. No clear provoking symptoms. CT abdomen/pelvis was 
negative for overt malignancy or metastases. Imaging did show 
pulmonary nodules that will need to be followed up with repeat 
imaging. Also, there is concern for malignancy related to her 
multinodular thyroid. She is scheduled to follow up with her 
endocrinologist regarding this. She was placed on enoxaparin 80 
mg q12hr per hematology recommendations. Hematology/Oncology was 
following her throughout admission as well.

#Gout. Patient had some left foot/ankle pain which impaired her 
ability to walk. It improved after colchicine administration. 
XRay of left foot was negative. 

#Atrial Fibrillation: Has chronic atrial fibrillation, and 
warfarin was discontinued as she developed upper extremity DVTs 
with therapeutic INR. Lovenox was initiated. Amiodarone was at 
first discontinued in the ICU, and then restarted on the floor. 
She was discharged on her home dose of 100 daily. Her PR 
interval was >200 and she was not considered a good candidate 
for a beta blocker while in house.

#Coronary Artery Disease: Stable. Continued atorvastatin, 
aspirin

#Hypertension: Stable. Continued home amlodipine, lisinopril

#Thyroid disease:Patient w/large goiter, and questionable effect 
on trachea. Followed by ___ endocrinology. IP and ENT at ___ 
will consider intervention pending whether there is malignancy 
within goiter, and overall patient prognosis. Methimazole was 
continued. Thyroglobulin pending at discharge.  Abd/pelvic CT 
without evidence of malignancy.

#MGUS: monoclonal IgG kappa represents only 1% of total protein. 
The rest of it, and IgA, are polyclonal. Free kappa and lambda 
light chains both slightly elevated, not worrisome for myeloma. 
No further evaluation needed. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#She was followed by hem/onc atrius as inpatient: PCP can refer 
her to Dr ___, ___ Heme, for further follow-up if deemed 
appropriate.

# For the PCP: IP can offer her a joint procedure with ENT 
regarding her large multinodular goiter and its impingement on 
the trachea when it is clear whether there is malignancy present 
or not, and what the overall prognosis of patient is. They can 
certainly stent her trachea if it starts to compromise her 
airway if that is within the patient goals of care. An 
appointment in interventional pulmonology/compromised ___ 
clinic is being made for her at ___ to follow up this issue.

#Multiple pulmonary nodules, the largest of which measures 7 mm. 
If clinically indicated, follow-up chest CT is suggested at ___ 
months. If there is no change, a second follow-up in ___ months 
and then at 24 months is recommended if there is no change. 

#Repeat FNA in 2 weeks with endocrinology. thyroglobulin pending 
at discharge

#nightly bipap: EPAP 5 IPAP 15 O2 flow: 6

#Patient started on Lovenox 80 mg sc BID for UE DVT which 
occurred while on warfarin

#Consider starting allopurinol for prevention of gout

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o F with hx of paroxysmal afib on warfarin, CKD stage III, 
HTN, PVD, DM2 who presents with palpitations and found to be in 
Afib with RVR.

The patient the morning of admission awoke with palpitations and 
feelings of axiety. She states that every day this week she had 
palpitations in the morning, with extra beats, but not a fast 
HR. She denies ever feeling short of breath.  Denies chest pain, 
fevers. Reports chronic ___ edema that has worsened over the 
past week, however no weight gain, orthopnea, PND. She was 
brought into the hospital by EMS, who noted respiratory distress 
and placed the patient on bipap. Her heart rate initially was in 
the 160s c/w Afib with RVR, and her SBP was in the 200s. 
 
In the ED, initial vitals were 138 130/69 29 100% bipap. EKG 
initially showed atrial fibrillation with RVR. 
Labs were notable for: pro-BNP of 3354, neg troponin, INR 2.9 
(on coumadin), initial CO2 of 58 and pH of 7.27, lactate of 2.2. 
UA showed lg leuks, pos nitrite, mod bacteria. CXR showed 
moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral 
pleural effusions.
The patient was was given: 50mg IV and 30mg PO diltiazem, ASA 
81mg,  furosemide 40mg IV x2, ceftriaxone, metoprolol tartrate 
25mg. 
The patient converted to sinus with diltiazem and with HRs then 
in the ___. BPs remained ___ in the ED.  The 
patient was weaned of Bipap and was satting well on RA prior to 
transfer. Vitals  prior to transfer: 98.2 67 128/52 18 98% RA. 

Of note, the patient has a history of paroxysmal Afib first 
diagnosed in ___, and on warfarin since ___. She had a recent 
admission at ___ for GI sypmtoms, and 
also complained of intermittent dizziness/lightheadedness when 
walking. During that admission she developed afib with RVR. At 
other times, she had sinus bradycardia but without any 
hypotension or dizziness. She was evaluated for possible 
pacemaker insertion. However, it was felt that she was not 
clearly symptomatic from her arrhythmia and a pacemaker was not 
clearly indicated.  Her metoprolol was increased during that 
admission and her hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine were 
discontinued due to concerns they could be contributing to her 
lightheadedness. She still reports intermittent lightheadedness 
when walking around.

On arrival to the floor, the patient is asymptomatic and feels 
well.

STUDIES:

CXR ___:
FINDINGS: A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest 
was obtained. Heart is mildly enlarged. Calcifications are 
present in the aortic arch. Deviation of the trachea to the 
right is probably due to an enlarged thyroid. There are diffuse 
bilateral opacities with perihilar distribution and more 
prominent in the lower zone, consistent with moderate-to-severe 
pulmonary edema. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are also 
present. The degree of pulmonary edema limits assessment for 
focal consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema and moderate 
bilateral pleural effusions. 

EKG: Atrial fibrillation with PVCs, Rate 127, normal axis, no ST 
changes, no TWI 

ECHO ___:
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). There is mild (non-obstructive) focal 
hypertrophy of the basal septum. The estimated cardiac index is 
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Diastolic function could not be 
assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Mild mitral regurgiation. Moderate pulmonary 
hypertension. 

CXR ___:
There is volume loss/ alveolar infiltrates in the lower lungs 
but overall the
appearance is much improved compared to the study from 2 days 
ago. There small
bilateral pleural effusions that are smaller compared to prior. 
There
continues to be pulmonary vascular redistribution and moderate 
to severe
cardiomegaly
IMPRESSION: 
Improvement in fluid status both pulmonary edema persist.

EKG ___:
Sinus rhythm. Occasional premature atrial contractions. Poor R 
wave
progression. There are biphasic T waves in the anterior leads. 
Cannot
rule out underlying myocardial ischemia. Compared to the 
previous tracing
of ___ biphasic anterolateral T waves are more pronounced. 
Clinical
correlation is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with hx of paroxysmal afib on warfarin, HTN, PVD who 
presented with palpitations, found to be in Afib with RVR. 

# Atrial fibrillation: The patient presented with Afib with RVR 
in the 160s, converted to sinus with diltiazem in the ED, and 
was in sinus for the rest of the admission. She was on warfarin 
and metoprolol at home. She was started on amiodarone 200mg 
daily in an effort to keep her into sinus rhythm. At discharge 
she was in sinus rhythm.  

# Volume overload: The patient presented with volume overload 
likely due to flash pulmonary edema from afib. On admission she 
had an elevated BNP, ___ edema, and findings of increased 
pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on CXR. Echocardiogram 
showed moderate pulm HTN, otherwise unremarkable. She received 
diuretics with improvement in her volume status. By discharge 
she was asymptomatic and feeling well. 

# Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive during admission. 
Of note, her amlodipine and HCTZ were recently stopped due to 
lightheadedness and low pressures. Her lisinopril was increased 
with better control of her pressures. She should follow up with 
her PCP for further titration of her medications.

# UTI: Patient with UCx growing klebsiella, however has 
suprapubic catheter and is at risk for colonization. Tha patient 
did not have any pain with palpation of suprapubic area, and the 
area around catheter looked clean, dry, and without drainage. No 
fever or white count. She was given a dose of ceftriaxone in the 
ED, but then was not continued on antibiotics since she was 
asymptomatic.
 
# Left neck mass: Patient with a history of multinodular goiter. 
Mass stable. Last ultrasound of the thyroid was in ___, 
which did not show any concerning findings. TSH mildly elevated 
at 4.7, T4 wnl. Should have repeat TFTs and neck US as 
outpatient.

# HLD: continued atorvastatin  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Started amiodarone and decreased metoprolol during admission 
to control atrial fibrillation.  Needs outpatient PFTs to 
establish baseline.
- INR was 2.0 on discharge; should get INR checked on ___
- Ongoing blood pressure titration
- TSH elevated during admission to 4.7, with normal T4. Should 
have follow up tests and repeat thyroid ultrasound 
- Encourage smoking cessation

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you during your stay. You were 
admitted for palpitations and anxiety, due to atrial 
fibrillation with high heart rates. You were given medicines in 
the ED that converted your heart rhythm back to sinus rhythm. 
You were started on amiodarone in order to keep you in the 
normal rhythm. In addition, during admission you had volume 
overload with fluid in your lungs. Echocardiogram showed 
moderate pulmonary hypertension but was mostly normal.  The 
volume overload was likely due to your fibrillation. You were 
given medicines to remove the fluid with good response. In 
addition, your lisinopril was increased due to high pressures. 
Please follow up with your cardiologist after discharge. We wish 
you the best!

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with a PMH of atrial fibrillation on 
warfarin and amiodarone, PE, CKD III, PVD, HTN, T2DM, and 
multinodular goiter recently started on methimazole, who was 
referred by her PCP for generalized weakness and decreased 
appetite, who presented with symptoms and UA consistent with 
UTI, no leukocytosis and no fever.

============
ACUTE ISSUES
============
#Complicated UTI. She had no fever or leukocytosis, and endorsed 
symptoms of urinary urgency and frequency, in the setting of 
suprapubic catheter for neurogenic bladder. She history of 
Pseudomonas (pan-sensitive) and Klebsiella UTIs in the past, 
with no CVA tenderness to suggest pyelonephritis. We avoided 
ciprofloxacin owing to history of prolonged QT. There was no 
evidence of pneumonia on plain film. She was treated with one 
dose of ceftriaxone in the ED, and then was monitored off 
antibiotics. Her urine culture grew GNRs, but this was thought 
to represent colonization. She did well off of antibiotics and 
was discharged without any further antibiotic treatment. 

# Toxic multinodular goiter. Mrs. ___ was recently started on 
methimazole 10 mg on ___. TSH 0.02 on ___ and she had a 
palpable, painless goiter.  Methimazole was held on admission 
but was restarted in the setting of thyroid studies showing 
suppressed TSH. 

# ___ on CKD, stage III. The was thought to be pre-renal in the 
setting of poor PO intake, and her creatinine improved from 1.5 
to 1.1 with the administration of fluids. 

# Generalized weakness. Her weakness had improved on admission 
and was thought to  represent infection vs. thyroid dysfunction 
in the setting of starting methimazole. There was no evidence of 
neurogenic or cardiovascular dysfunction. No syncope or loss of 
consciousness. We opted to pursue UTI treatment, encouragement 
of PO intake, and maintenance fluids as above. 

==============
CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# Neurogenic bladder. Suprapubic catheter, secondary to diabetic 
nephropathy, with Foley change by urology approximately once per 
month with annual cystoscopy. 

# Tobacco use. Nicotine patch was offered but declined.

# T2DM. Diet-controlled. A1c of 6.1% in ___. 

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In normal sinus rhythm. 
Warfarin and amiodarone were continued.

# Hypertension. Home lisinopril, amlodipine and HCTZ were 
continued. 

# Hyperlipidemia. Home atorvastatin and aspirin were continued

# Iron deficiency anemia. Home ferrous sulfate 325 mg was 
continued.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for weakness and concern for a 
urinary tract infection. You were initially treated with 
antibiotics, but because our suspicion that you had a urinary 
tract infection was low since you didn't have a fever and your 
bloodwork did not show signs of infection, we decided to 
discontinue antibiotics and to observe you for 24 hours. During 
that time, you continued to feel well, so we felt it was safe to 
send you home.

Please take all of your discharge medications as prescribed. We 
recommend that you make a follow-up appointment with someone 
from your primary care physician's practice this week to make 
sure you are still doing okay.

We wish you all the very best!

Warmly,
Your ___ Team

___ Intra-op TEE:
Conclusions  
PRE-BYPASS: 
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen 
in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast is 
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A 
mass 5cm x 3.5 cm consistent with a myxoma or tumor is seen in 
the body of the left atrium. The mass was attached to the fossa 
ovalis portion of the interatrial septum with a broad base of 
2cm. No other attachments were seen. It was seen prolapsing into 
the left ventricle in diastole with no flow compromise. 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are 
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 40cm 
from the incisors. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 
Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results before surgical 
incision.

POST-BYPASS: 
Normal biventricular systolic funciton.
Mitral valve anatomy and function normal.
Interatrial septum post patc h closure is intact.
Intact thoracic aorta.
No other new findings.   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent removal of left atrial mass with Dr. 
___.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and 
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient 
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient 
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy 
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time 
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the

abnormalities. Here she was hypotensive (although intial vitals
here were 130/64) and so she was taken off propofol and placed 
on
a midazolam gtt. She was very agitated and required several 
midaz
boluses.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year-old woman with hx of olfactory groove
meningioma s/p resection in ___ who presents as a transfer 
from ___, intubated, for concern of status epilepticus. 
Was on prophylactic dilantin since resection but denies a 
history of seizures. 

Neuro: The patient arrived intubated and was admitted to the 
ICU. She had already been loaded with dilantin so she was 
continued on her home dose. The patient was monitored on 
continuous EEG and did not have any further seizure activity. 
The second day of admission she was able to follow commands 
while off sedation so she was successfully extubated. She was 
transfered to the floor and did well. She was seen by physical 
therapy who recommended home ___. We also did an MRI to look for 
any reemergence of her meningioma that could have triggered the 
seizure but this showed only post-surgical changes. Her seizure 
was likely caused by a combination of her underlying 
vulnerability since meningioma resection plus an infection. 
Because of this she was continued on her home dose of dilantin 
with a goal level of ___.

ID: In the early morning after admission the patient spiked a 
fever to 103. She was empirically started on cefepime, acyclovir 
and ampicillin to cover for meningitis. She had an extensive 
work up including a lumbar puncture (WBC 1, RBC 1). No 
infectious source was identified and the HSV PCR was negative so 
all of her antibiotics were discontinued. 

Transition of care issues: Her PCP ___ arrange 
neurology follow up close to their home. A dilantin level will 
need to be checked in 10 days, goal ___

 
Medications on Admission:

NO drift. Family reports that there are no cognitive or 
behavioral changes.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital because of a seizure. You were 
intubated at an outside hospital due to concerns that you might 
stop breathing during the seizure. You were then transfered to 
___. You had a fever the first day you were here but we could 
not find any source of an infection. You were intially placed on 
broad antibiotics but these have be stopped since all tests were 
negative. You were monitored on EEG while you were intubated and 
there was no further evidence of seizure. You were extubated and 
continued on your home dose of dilantin. Our thought is that you 
had a seizure as a result of your recent brain surgery in 
addition to an infection. We recommend that you follow up with a 
neurologist (will be arranged by your primary doctor), continue 
dilantin with a goal level of ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ presented to OSH with acute onset left leg numbness and 
weakness. He received IV tPA and was transferred to ___ for 
monitoring. 

# NEURO
At ___, he was found to have proximal>distal weakness of the 
left lower extremity with some improvement in his sensory 
deficit.  His lower extremity exam had some functional overlay 
and was variable from day to day. He was monitored in the ICU 
for 24 hours without change in his examination and there was no 
evidence hemorrhagic transformation on his CT head.  The 
etiology of his symptoms remained unclear. CTA head and neck was 
difficult to interpret given timing of contrast, possibly with a 
cutoff in R ACA territory, but there was no evidence of evolving 
infarct within the limits of CT on repeat scan.  An echo was 
done, but was of poor quality.  

His stroke risk factors were assessed and include: 1) 
dyslipidemia, 2) IDDM, 3) HTN, 4) Obesity.  Lipid panel revealed 
low LDL and HDL and elevated triglycerides with a high 
triglyceride to LDL ratio.  Diabetes management is discussed 
below. His blood pressure was in good control ranging between 
130-160's/50's-70's. His home aspirin was restarted and his 
simvastatin and fenofibrates were continued. No meds were 
changed.

# HEME/ONC
His outpatient oncologist recommended holding is ibrutinib for 
24 hours after tPA due to elevated bleeding risk. This will be 
restarted as outpatient.

# THYROID
He was continued on his home levothyroxine. His thyroid function 
tests were notable for an elevated TSH at 30 T3-93. 

# DIABETES
His A1c was elevated at 7.4% and his metformin was initially 
held after contrast. He was maintained on insulin glargine and 
sliding scale. His ___ were elevated and that was the result of 
giving him 50 ___ at bedtime when he typically has it 
twice a day.  At discharge, his diabetes regimen was restarted 
as per his home regimen given that his blood glucose was well 
controlled ___ that regiment and this was confirmed with ___ 
Diabetes consult team. 

# MUSKULOSKELETAL
He complained of Left shoulder pain  with a remote hx of trauma, 
we had a shoulder X-ray that was negative and pain was well 
controlled on Ibuprofen and Vicodin which he sues at home

Dear Mr. ___,

You came to ___ because you were having chest pain. We 
evaluated you very carefully and determined that you were not

coming from your heart. Your symptoms are probably coming from 
your ribs and the muscles of your chest. We recommend Tylenol

==================================
SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
For pharmacologic stress dipyridamole was infused intravenously 
for
approximately 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 
milligram/kilogram/min. 1 to 2
minutes after the cessation of infusion, the stress dose of the 
radiotracer was
injected.
 
FINDINGS:  Calculated end-diastolic volume is 133 cc, however 
visual observation
suggests that the left ventricular cavity size is normal.
 
There is a small fixed defect within the inferior wall that is 
consistent with attenuation and does not appear on the 
attenuation correction images..
Otherwise, rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform 
tracer uptake
throughout the left ventricular myocardium.
 
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 65%.
 
IMPRESSION:  Normal myocardial perfusion study
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with history of CAD s/p PCI to the LAD, atrial 
fibrillation s/p PPM, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and 
recent diagnosis of testicular cancer presenting with chest pain 
with no ischemic ST changes, negative troponins x 3, and  normal 
myocardial perfusion study, likely in setting of anxiety.   

# Atypical chest pain: 
Patient with known CAD and recent PCI to LAD in ___ with recent 
holding of clopidogrel in setting of orchiectomy (although > 3 
months post stent). Patient notes abrupt onset of chest pain 
initially reported as similar in character to prior MI but later 
reported that he thought this was most likely secondary to 
anxiety and was much improved with benzodiazepines. EKG without 
ischemic ST changes, atrially paced. Troponin I negative at 
___ x 1, troponin T negative x 2 here. Patient was initially 
placed on nitro gtt and continued on home rivaroxaban given 
history of known coronary artery disease. Given history of CAD, 
patient underwent p-MIBI with dipyridamole stress. No anginal 
type symptoms or significant ST segment changes. Nuclear report- 
normal myocardial perfusion study with calculated LVEF 65%. 
Suspect that chest pain may be secondary to anxiety given recent 
diagnosis of testicular cancer.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Troponins negative x 3, nuclear stress test without evidence 
of ischemia
[] Chest pain most likely related to anxiety, please consider 
social work for coping as an outpatient
- No changes were made to patient's home medications

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

You came to us after sudden onset of chest pain at rest, which 
initially reminded you of your prior heart attack.

While you were here with us, we performed multiple EKGs and sent 
out blood tests to look for a heart attack. Good news- this did 
not demonstrate anything that was concerning for a heart attack. 
Due to your history of a stent in ___, we ordered a nuclear 
stress test, which DID NOT demonstrate any heart damage!

As you had been under significant stress recently in the setting 
of new diagnosis of testicular cancer, we would like to 
encourage you to talk to social work as an outpatient. 

Please take care, we wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

On arrival to the floor, patient reports concern about his 
elevated lipase and white blood cell count, he thinks his cancer 
may have extended to his pancreas and that his CLL has worsened 
for being off the ibrutinib. He continues to feel tired, the 
nausea he felt in the emergency room has improved with 
ondansetron. He is afraid that his kidneys are failing and he 
would not like to be on dialysis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old gentleman with history of CAD s/p DES, 
SSS s/p PPM, pAF on rivaroxaban in addition to Rai III CLL on 
ibrutinib (currently on hold) and Stage IIIA NSGCT s/p radical 
orchiectomy and now s/p initiation of cycle 2 (___) of 
Cisplatin/Etoposide who presents with generalized weakness, poor 
PO intake, a fall and abdominal discomfort. 

#Weakness:
#Hypovolemia:
#Acute Kidney Injury:
Weakness and fatigue are similar to what he experienced for a 
week during his first cycle of chemotherapy. Volume depleted on 
admission due to poor PO intake and ongoing use of furosemide. 
Cr elevated to 1.3 on admission, was given 1 L IVF with 
improvement in Cr to 0.9. Flu swab negative, respiratory viral 
panel negative for Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, Influenza A, B, 
and RSV; viral culture pending at the time of discharge. Held 
furosemide and losartan during this admission, but will resume 
on discharge. 

#S/P Fall: 
Suspect that fall was due to orthostatic factors, owing to 
volume depletion. Low suspicion for arrhythmia. No suspicion for 
ACS or seizure. No secondary injuries on exam. Patient was 
ambulatory in the hospital and did not need ___ evaluation.

#Epigastric discomfort 
#Nausea
#Hyperlipasemia:
Patient had significant upper GI upset and nausea after previous 
cycle of chemotherapy so likely attributable to chemotherapy. 
Mildly elevated lipase very unlikely to represent pancreatitis 
given absence of significant abdominal pain or tenderness. 
Contributing factors for hyperlipasemia in this patient are 
furosemide, renal failure, valproate, narcotics, RYGB. Continued 
Ondansetron, and added prochlorperazine and Ativan. Continued 
home pantoprazole and added sucralfate. Lipase trended down. 
Pt's diet was advanced without issue.

#Stage IIIA Non-seminoma testicular cancer
#Leukocytosis with Neutrophilia: 
With low risk features. Has completed C2 ___ C2D1) of 
cisplatin/etoposide. Received pegfilgrastim on ___ which 
explains his leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Did not receive any 
chemotherapy while in-house.

#Rai Stage III Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: 
Lymphocytosis to 11.48 on differential up from 3.39 on ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION:
___ yo male with a history of CLL and more recently testicular 
cancer who is admitted with fevers, cough, and sore throat. 
Course notable for nausea, vomiting, and intermittent 
palpitations.

# Fever: 
# Parainfluenza bronchitis/pharyngitis: Patient febrile to 
arrival, but no fever noted in the hospital. Blood and urine 
cultures remain negative. Most prominent symptoms were sore 
throat, dry cough, and nausea/vomiting. He was treated 
symptomatically and slowly improved during his course. 
Nasopharyngeal swab obtained on admission eventually grew 
parainfluenza type 3. Of note, CTA showed
mild area of possible infection in RLL, and he was empirically 
started
on clindamycin for aspiration PNA (has PCN allergy). However, 
this was discontinued
after one day given concern it was worsening his nausea. 
Additionally, noted to have low IgG/IgM, we discussed with his 
outpatient oncology team and decided against IVIG.

# Nausea/vomiting - Patient developed marked nauasea and 
vomiting on hospital days 2 and 3. Abdomen was benign on exam 
and LFT/chemistry panel generally unremarkable. He did have 
elevated white count but no diarreha to suggest CDiff. Somewhat 
unclear etiology, but ultimately felt related to parainfluenzae. 
Greatly improved after reducing dietary allowance, and slowly 
advanced back to full diet. He was treated supportively 
treatment with IV zofran, compazine, ativan and olanzapine as 
needed

# Palpitations
# Dyspnea on exertion: Patient reported several weeks of DOE and 
palpitations with exertion. He continued to have these during 
his stay, although no VS derangements were noted during 
episodes. Had been thought that symptomatic anemia was playing a 
role, but no significant improvement with 2 units pRBC. He was 
monitored on telemetry, and ACS ruled out with serial troponins. 
CTA was negative for PE. Cardiology was consulted interrogate 
PPM, and no significant arrhythmias were noted. 

# Left lower extremity swelling - Likely worsened in setting of 
holding home Lasix and providing IVF for nausea/vomiting. ___ 
was negative for DVT.

# Hyponatremia: Na was noted to be 128 on day of discharge. Felt 
likely due to nausea and vomiting and decreased po intake day 
prior. Urine was appropriately dilute, and was given 500cc 
additional fluid. Na improved to 131 prior to discharge.

# Anemia, chemotherapy induced: No signs of active bleeding. SP 
2 units pRBC.

# Leukocytosis: Most likely due to recent neulasta and less
likely from CLL given profound left shift. No clear bacterial
infection, as above, and antibiotics were held, aside from one 
day of clindamycin. 

# Testicular Cancer: Received C2D1 etoposide and cisplatin on 
___. Received
neulasta on ___. Next cycle planned for ___, ultimately 
deferred to next week. 

# CLL: Treatment on hold while the patient is being treated for
testicular cancer. Continued home acyclovir.

# DM: Continued home lantus. Held home metformin while in house 
and maintained HISS.

# CAD: Continued home aspirin, atorvastatin, clonidine, Plavix, 
Lasix,
and losartan.

# Depression/Anxiety: Continued home trazadone, ziprasidone, 
fluoxetine, and
divalproex.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine.

# Atrial Fibrillation: Continue home metoprolol and rivaroxaban.

FEN: 
- Electrolytes per oncology scales
- Regular diet
PAIN:
- Continue home gabapentin. Oxycodone PRN. Avoid Tylenol acutely
to avoid masking fevers.
BOWEL REGIMEN:
- Continue home Colace and senna.
DVT PROPHYLAXIS:
- Continue home rivaroxaban.
ACCESS: 
- Port

BILLING: >30 minutes spend planning and executing this discharge 
plan.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please follow up in clinic on ___ to consider next cycle chemo
- Please recheck Na to monitor hyponatremia

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of CLL on 
ibrutinib, non-seminoma testicular GCT (T2N2M1a, stage IIIA) s/p 
EP x4 completed ___ with normalization of markers and 
residual LAD <1 cm (now on surveillance), CAD s/p LAD PCI in 
___, SSS s/p PPM, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on 
rivaroxaban, CVA, DMII, depression who presented with BRBPR.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# GI Bleed:
# Acute on chronic normocytic anemia with acute blood loss: Hgb 
remained stable during hospitlization, without any transfusion 
requirement. Vitals remained stable as well. No significant 
bleeding observed while hospitalized. Patient required extremely 
prolonged colonoscopy preparation (>4 days, with 15+ MoviPrep & 
magnesium citrate, with 2 colonoscopies with inadequate 
preparation. Colonsocopy ultimately revealed two benign 
appearing polyps which were biopsied as well as internal 
hemorrhoids. Clopidogrel stopped, after discussion with 
cardiologist, as >12 months after PCI/stenting. Ibrutinib & 
rivaroxaban held, per discussion with oncologist, Dr. ___, 
___ restarted at discharge. Aspirin dose decreased to 81 mg 
daily

# Hyponatremia: developed during bowel preparation. Improved 
with IV NS

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# CLL: WBC remained mostly stable. Ibrutinib held, as above, and 
restarted at discharge. Continued home acyclovir. 

# Testicular Cancer: He is s/p treatment with 
etoposide/cisplatin with plan for surveillance. Follow-up with 
Dr. ___ as scheduled. 

# DMII complicated by
# Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Long acting insulin was 
transiently held during limited po intake with bowel prep and 
adjusted during hospitalization. Discharged on lantus 50 units 
BID but will require close monitoring (and likely uptitration) 
as an outpatient

# CAD s/p PCI:
# Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Per d/w pt's cardiologist Dr. 
___ on ___, ok to decrease home ASA from 243 to 81mg daily 
and to discontinue clopidogrel  altogether as it has been >12 
months since last PCI. Continued home atorvastatin and 
fenofibrate. Held home Lasix and losartan in setting of GI 
bleed. Home dose metoprolol initially held but restarted ___

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation:
# History of CVA:
# SSS s/p PPM:
Held home rivaroxaban in setting of GI bleed. Resumed home-dose 
metoprolol ___ ___, resumed rivaroxaban at discharge

# Depression/Anxiety
Continued home trazodone, ziprasidone, fluoxetine, clonidine, 
and divalproex. Added PRN low-dose lorazepam for increased 
anxiety while hospitalized, discontinued at discharge

# Hypothyroidism
Continued home levothyroxine

# Chronic Back/Shoulder Pain
Continue home Vicodin, gabapentin, and lidocaine. Pt received 
PRN one-time doses of IV morphine for breakthrough pain with 
good effect

Transitional Issues:
====================
- biopsy results from colonoscopy pending at discharge
- clopidogrel stopped
- ASA decreased to 81mg daily
- persistently hypoglycemic requiring D10W drip though this was 
in the setting of NPO and colonoscopy prep. Lantus decreased to 
50 units BID, please increase as an outpatient prn

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You are admitted to the hospital for evaluation of bleeding from 
the rectum. You are on a number of medications that can increase 
your risk of bleeding. We contacted your cardiologist Dr. ___ 
___ agrees with stopping Plavix (clopidogrel), since it has been 
more than 12 months since you had a stent placed.

You required a very prolonged preparation for your colonoscopy, 
which showed 2 polyps. They were removed.

Please monitor your blood sugars very closely at home, and call 
your primary doctor if you have any sugars over 300 or lower 
than 70. Your sugars were very low here so we decreased your 
lantus to 50 units twice a day, but once you restart your 
regular diet you may need to increase your insulin back to 75 
units twice a day. 

***Please note the adjustments to your medications on the 
medication reconciliation sheet***

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

PORTABLE CXR ___:
===================
FINDINGS:  
  
Streaky opacity at the right lung base likely represents 
atelectasis.  No 
dense consolidative opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax 
identified on single view.  Right-sided chest port is seen with 
tip likely terminating over the right atrium.  A left-sided 
pacemaker is seen. Mild cardiomegaly appears similar. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
No definite acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

TTE ___:
==========
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global 
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. 
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Trivial pericardial 
effusion. Preserved global left ventricular systolic function. 
Mildly dilated aortic sinus. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower/normal.  

CARDIAC PERFUSION ___:
========================
SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: 
For pharmacologic stress 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg/ml) was 
infused 
intravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. 
  
FINDINGS:  Computer calculated end-diastolic volume is 
borderline at 114 cc, however, left ventricular cavity size 
visually appears normal. 
  
Rest and stress perfusion images again reveal a small inferior 
fixed defect, likely secondary to attenuation artifact.  
Otherwise, there is uniform tracer uptake throughout the left 
ventricular myocardium. 
  
Gated images reveal normal wall motion. 
  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 62 %. 
  
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study. 
  
STRESS TEST ___:
==================
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with a history of 
hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease 
(s/p LAD PCI ___, referred as an inpatient for the evaluation 
of chest pain after serial negative cardiac biomarkers. He 
underwent pharmacologic vasodilator perfusion study with 
0.4mg/5ml of regadenason over 20 seconds prior to tracer 
injection. There was no report of any chest, back, arm, jaw, or 
neck discomfort throughout the study. There were no significant 
STTW changes. The vasodilator effect was reversed with 125mg of 
aminophylline IV. The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with 
occasional ventricular paced beats and no ectopy. There was an 
appropriate hemodynamic response to regadenason. 

IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or significant STTW changes. 
Nuclear 
report sent separately. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
___ male with PMH of CAD s/p drug-eluting stent in ___, 
sick sinus syndrome status post pacemaker in ___, paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, and CLL who 
presented with midsternal chest pain and
diffuse ST-segment elevations consistent with pericarditis. 

#CORONARIES: Mid LAD stent  
#PUMP: >55%  
#RHYTHM: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============

#CHEST PAIN
#PERICARDITIS
Patient presented with ___ mid-sternal chest pain.  Patient's 
troponins were negative X4 and d-dimer also negative which 
provided reassurance of non-ACS and non-PE event. Recreation of 
patient's chest
pain with palpation of his chest wall was initially thought to 
be most consistent with a costochondritis.  However, EKG 
obtained upon admission showed diffuse ST elevations consistent 
with pericarditis and the patient was treated empirically for 
pericarditis. TTE showed a trivial pericardial effusion and 
preserved global left ventricular systolic function with a 
mildly dilated aortic sinus. As the patient was unable to 
receive NSAIDs due to known CAD and questionable GI bleed on 
last admission, he was started on colchicine and prednisone. 
This combination improved his chest pain overall, though he 
continued to have occasional episodes of midsternal pain leading 
up to discharge. These episodes were all self-limiting and were 
not associated with any new EKG changes or troponin elevations.  
The patient underwent a stress test to ensure no ischemic 
disease. He had no anginal symptoms or significant STTW changes 
during the pharmacological stress and myocardial perfusion was 
normal. The patient will be discharged on colchicine (0.6 mg 
BID) and a prednisone taper.

___
Patient's creatinine bumped from 1.1 on admission to 2.2 on 
___. Patient had been NPO prior to myocardial perfusion study 
and the etiology of the ___ was thought to be pre-renal. This 
was supported by urine electrolytes studies which revealed a 
urine Na < 20 and urine Cl also < 20, consistent with sodium 
avid state. The patient was treated with a 1.5 liter fluid bolus 
and his creatinine rapidly downtrended. The patient's creatinine 
was 1.2 on discharge. 

#DM
Patient's blood sugars were monitored closely during this 
admission. He initially was very poorly controlled with blood 
sugars in the mid ___. This was likely due to a delay in 
restarting his home dose of Lantus 75 units BID (he had been 
initially placed on 50 units BID). Metformin was held on 
admission and the patient was placed on a sliding scale short 
acting insulin in addition to above metformin. Given the 
patient's need for 2 weeks of prednisone therapy to treat his 
pericarditis, ___ was consulted to provide input regarding 
adequate glucose control while on steroids during this time. The 
___ team recommended adding  5 units of Homolog with a 
Humalog pen before meals. This dose was deemed appropriate to 
help control blood sugars while on prednisone and also safe 
enough to be continued after the steroid taper has finished. 

#Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
Patient in sinus rhythm upon admission. The patient's home 
metoprolol was continued for rate control. The patient's home 
rivaroxaban was 10 mg. Unclear why patient on this dose but he 
has been maintained on 10 mg daily since at least the end of 
___. Given the patient's normal kidney function at baseline, 
the dose was increased to 20 mg daily prior to discharge in 
order to ensure adequate anticoagulation for atrial 
fibrillation.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============

#CLL
Patient presented with leukocytosis to 25.6 the setting of his 
underlying CLL.  He takes ibrutinib as an outpatient which has 
been controlling his symptoms. This medication was unfortunately 
not on formulary at ___. His wife was able to bring in his 
home ibrutinib to take while hospitalized. Acyclovir was 
continued at his home dose.

#CHRONIC PAIN
Patient is taking a number of medications at home to treat 
chronic pain in the shoulders as well as in his back.  We 
continued all of these medications while he is in the hospital.

#HYPOTHYROIDISM
Continued home levothyroxine

#INSOMNIA
Continued home ramelteon, trazodone, ziprasidone

#HLD
Continued home atorvastatin and fenofibrate.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================

Patient hospitalized for chest pain without evidence of ischemic 
disease. Troponin and stress test both unremarkable. EKG notable 
for diffuse STE consistent with presumptive diagnosis of 
idiopathic acute pericarditis. Patient placed on prednisone 
taper rather than NSAIDs given history of CAD and possible 
history of GIB. He was also started on colchicine which will be 
continued as an outpatient. Patient seen by ___ team for 
better blood sugar control and they recommended starting 5 units 
of Humalog before meals. Rivaroxaban dose increased to 20 mg 
daily from 10 mg daily given no contraindication to do so and 10 
mg subtherapeutic anticoagulation for patient's with atrial 
fibrillation. Needs to have CBC monitored closely after 
discharge to make sure H/H stable on higher dose.

NEW MEDICATIONS:
- Homolog pen 5 units prior to meals
- Colchicine 0.6 mg PO/NG BID for 3 months
- Prednisone taper as follows: 40 mg daily on the day of 
discharge, and the following day (___), then 30 mg daily for 3 
days, then 20 mg daily for 3 days, then 10 mg daily for 3 days, 
then off

CHANGED MEDICATIONS:
- Rivaroxaban changed from 10 mg daily to 20 mg daily

STOPPED MEDICATIONS:
- None

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___

___ was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___!

WHY WERE YOU IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You came to the hospital because of chest pain in the center 
of your chest.
- This pain became severe enough to make it difficult for you to 
breathe.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You had laboratory tests which showed that you were not having 
a heart attack.
- You had an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your 
heart. This showed that you may have inflammation of the lining 
around the heart (called the pericardium).
- You were given medications to control your pain and started on 
steroids to reduce the inflammation of the pericardium.
- You were seen by the diabetes doctor in order to better 
control your blood sugar while on the steroids. 
- Your kidney's were injured while in the hospital. This was 
likely caused by taking off too much fluid. Your kidney function 
improved by the time you left the hospital.
- You also had a stress test to assess the blood vessels 
surrounding your heart muscle. This was normal. 

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL?
- You should take all of your medications as prescribed 
- You should follow up with your primary care doctor
- You should follow up with ___ at Dr. ___ 
office on ___ at 10:00 am.

We wish you the best!

None
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with H/O CLL on ibrutinib, metastatic 
testicular cancer, CAD s/p mid LAD PCI in ___, SSS s/p 
pacemaker, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, and 
diabetes mellitus with recent pericarditis (admission from 
___ who presented with chest pain and was found to be 
hypotensive requiring ICU admission. 

Prior to presentation to the ___ on ___, he had ___ substernal 
chest pain. He was taken to the ___. Imaging 
including bedside echocardiogram unremarkable. CTA without 
evidence of pulmonary embolus. His systolic blood pressure 
dropped to 80's, and he was transferred to the ___ ___. In the 
___, he was seen by cardiology who felt his picture was most 
consistent with septic shock given fever of 102. He had relative 
hypotension in this setting which was fluid responsive. He had 
continued tachycardia while in the ___ so he was admitted to the 
ICU.

In the ICU, he was weaned off BiPAP and breathing on room air. 
His blood pressure recovered, and tachycardia improved with 
reintroduction of metoprolol at home dose of 12.5 mg TID. Blood 
and urine cultures sent and given fever, he was empirically 
started on vancomycin+cefepime while awaiting culture results. 
His rivaroxaban was held in the setting of worsening kidney 
function.
  
Of note, during his recent admission from ___, he had 
midsternal chest pain with diffuse ST elevations. Echocardiogram 
demonstrated trivial pericardial effusion, so a presumptive 
diagnosis of pericarditis. He was treated with colchicine and 
prednisone with improvement in his chest pain, although the 
patient continued to have episodes of pain up to discharge. He 
was discharged on colchicine with prednisone taper.

He also had a recent admission in ___ where he had a GI 
bleed thought to be due to combination of ibrutinib, 
clopidogrel, and rivaroxaban. His clopidogrel was ultimately 
discontinued. There is also a remark about a vitreous hemorrhage 
occurring due to ibrutinib.

On transfer, patient noted ongoing stable chest pain improved 
with oxycodone. He had mild shortness of breath but no new 
cough. He had no acute complaints and denied fever, chills, 
abdominal pain, constipation, ___ swelling.

reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation.

___ CT chest w/out contrast
1. New small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent 
consolidations at the lung bases, left greater than right, 
likely representing atelectasis, however superimposed infection 
is difficult to exclude.
2. New moderate pericardial effusion.

___ Echocardiogram
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is beat-to-beat variability 
of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular 
rhythm/premature beats. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened (?#). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Focused study. Suboptimal image quality. LV function 
appears preserved. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Trivial 
pericardial effusion. 
  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
the rhythm is now afib and HR higher. Pericardial effusion very 
slighlty larger however still trivial.

___ Echocardiogram
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is a small to 
moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion. There is 
right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired 
fillling/tamponade physiology but no respiratory eccentuatlon of 
transmitral flow. A left pleural effusion is present. 
  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the pericardial effusion is now larger and increased pericardial 
pressure is now suggested. 

___ Pericardiocentesis
Under US, fluoro, ECG and hemo guidance, and after local 
anesthesia, the pericardial space was entered using 17 Tuhioy 
needle. Initial pericardial pressure was markedly elevated and 
after removing 470 ml of bloody fluid, pressure became negative 
with improvement in BP and rapid wean of pressors.
___ Pericardial Fluid 
-Negative for malignant cells 
-Abundant blood. 
-Lymphocytes, histiocytes, and mesothelial cells 

___ Head CT
  Study is mildly to moderately motion degraded despite multiple 
acquisitions. Within this confine, there is no evidence of acute 
infarction,hemorrhage,edema,or mass effect. There is prominence 
of the ventricles and sulci suggestive of involutional changes. 
Multiple periventricular hypodensities, probably sequela of 
chronic small vessel disease. There are atherosclerotic 
calcifications of the carotid siphon and the vertebral arteries 
bilaterally.
  There is no evidence of fracture. The visualized portion of 
the paranasal sinuses is unremarkable. There is mild 
opacification of the mastoid air cells. The middle ear cavities 
are remarkable. The visualized portion of the orbits are 
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Within confines of a mildly to moderately motion degraded 
examination, no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality on 
noncontrast head CT. Specifically, no large territory infarct or 
intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Additional findings described above.

___ Echocardiogram
LIMITED STUDY/FOCUSED VIEWS/SUBOPTIMAL IMAGE QUALITY: Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There 
is abnormal septal motion/position. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the pericardial effusion has nearly resolved. 

___ Echocardiogram
Very limited study due to suboptimal image quality. There is a 
very small posterior pericardial effusion. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
no obvious change but the technically suboptimal nature of both 
studies precludes definitive comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo man with H/O CLL on ibrutinib, metastatic 
testicular cancer, CAD s/p mid LAD DES in ___, SSS now s/p 
pacemaker, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, 
diabetes mellitus and recent admissions for GI bleed and 
subsequently pericarditis (___) discharged on prednisone, 
who re-presented with chest pain. He was admitted to F-ICU for 
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, fever and 
hypotension. He was treated with cefepime for HAP and was 
transferred to cardiology for treatment of ongoing pericarditis. 
He was started on high-dose aspirin which improved his 
pericarditis pain. Unfortunately, this was complicated by 
hemopericardium and hypotension for which he required CCU 
transfer and pericardial drainage. He was then transferred back 
to the cardiology service on prednisone for his pericarditis and 
prior to discharge anticoagulation was resumed. His ibrutinib 
was not restarted per his outpatient oncologist.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Pericarditis/pericardial effusion: Patient with recent 
hospitalization for pericarditis ___ on 
colchicine and prednisone taper, returned with ongoing chest 
pain with exertion, which was same in quality. Etiology of 
effusion presumed viral vs. malignancy. He was started on 
Aspirin 650 mg TID. This was complicated by pericardial effusion 
for which he was admitted to CCU. Following pericardiocentesis, 
500 cc bloody fluid was removed via the pericardial drain. Chest 
pain resolved by end of admission and on discharge. In 
discussion with patient's oncologist, Dr. ___ ibrutinib 
was discontinued as it increased his bleeding risk while on 
aspirin and rivaroxaban. Patient was continued on colchicine and 
prednisone. Continued pantoprazole 40 mg daily for GI 
prophylaxis. Colchicine should be continued for 3 months after 
___. Patient will need prednisone taper. Recommend tapering to 
5 mg for ___ weeks before stopping after patient sees 
cardiologist on ___.

# Transaminitis: Unclear etiology of abnormal LFTs in the 2000s 
that developed in CCU. No new medications. Viral hepatitis panel 
negative. These could represent decreased perfusion vs. shock 
liver. His acetaminophen, fenofibrate, and statin were held. His 
transaminases improved but remained elevate and will need 
monitoring as outpatient to confirm values normalize.

# ___: Baseline creatinine 0.9-1.0, but increased to 2.0. This 
likely reflects pre-renal physiology in the setting of 
hypotension and improved after pericardial fluid drained. 
Creatinine improved to 1.1 at discharge.

# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Repeat echo with 
intact LVEF >55% and evidence of pulmonary hypertension likely 
secondary to OSA. Bilateral pulmonary effusions on CT chest with 
likely dry weight of ~270, increased to 278 on
admission. Patient continued on home furosemide 20 mg daily then 
reduced to furosemide 20 mg every other day as his weight 
remained stable. Home losartan was restarted at a reduced dose 
of 25 mg daily. Discharge weight: 119.9 kg (264.5 lb). 

# Atrial fibrillation: Patient developed atrial fibrillation 
with rapid ventricular rate increased to 120s. Metoprolol was 
increased to 37.5 q6hr then consolidated to metoprolol succinate 
XL 150 mg daily. After ibrutinib was stopped, patient was 
restarted on rivaroxaban 20 mg daily.

# CAD s/p LAD PCI: Aspirin was held in setting of hemorrhagic 
pericardial effusion. Aspirin 81 mg daily restarted after 
ibrutinib was stopped for prevention of stent thrombosis (mid 
LAD DES from ___ on ___. Held atorvastatin given elevated 
LFTs. 

# Polyuria: Unclear precipitant, no recent changes in 
medications. Patient reports
he has recently begun drinking copious amounts of H2O upon 
initiation of Ibrutinib. Ibrutinib was stopped. Unlikely 
diabetes insipidus given concentrated urine electrolytes 
(osmolol 459). This also this occurred in the setting of 
hyperglycemia with some glycosuria, ___ was consulted for 
improved glucose control (see below).

# Diabetes mellitus: ___ followed. While patient was on 
hospital diet, he was managed with lantus 75 Units qAM with 
Humalog coverage with meals and ISS per ___ recommendations. 
Discharged on home diabetic regimen. This was communicated with 
Elderly Services. 

# OSA: Patient reports he has a CPAP mask at night for OSA but 
does not use it. He was given BiPAP in ___. VBG at the time was 
7.37/43. Oxygen saturations improved to high ___ on RA. Sats 
remained normal without CPAP at night. 

# Schizoaffective disorder: Continued divalproic acid, 
fluoxetine, ziprosadone. Followed QTc.

# CLL: Per oncologist, stopped ibrutinib. Patient has follow-up 
with oncology. 

RESOLVED ISSUES 
# Altered mental status: This occurred in the setting of 
hypotension, however high risk of CVA given anticoagulation. 
Stat head CT head negative. Mental status improved. 

# Hyponatremia: Component of hyperglycemia as well as true 
hyponatremia, suspect related to hypervolemia. Improved with 
fluid restriction.

# Hospital acquired pneumonia: CT chest with bilateral pleural 
effusions as well as
consolidations concerning for HAP in setting of fever and 
hypotension on presentation. He was treated with cefepime ___ 
- ___.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Patient's ibrutinib was stopped. CLL management per 
oncologist. 
# Patient needs repeat TTE to re-evaluate pericardial effusion 
within ___ weeks. 
# Patient's home losartan was restarted at lower dose, please 
monitor BP and uptitrate as tolerated 
# Patient's home metoprolol tartrate was switched to metoprolol 
succinate XL 150 mg daily
# Patient's home clonidine, 0.1 mg TID, was stopped due to 
hypotension and altered mental status. Please monitor 
anxiety/agitation and resume as needed. 
# Patient restarted on aspirin 81 mg to prevent thrombosis of 
his mid LAD drug-eluting stent and rivaroxaban 20 mg daily for 
embolic prevention in setting of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 
Please continue to monitor for bleeding. 
# Patient's home furosemide was adjusted to 20 mg every other 
day. Please monitor volume status and weight, increase as 
needed. 
# Patient discharged on prednisone 10 mg daily and colchicine 
0.6 mg BID for pericarditis. He was not continued on high dose 
NSAIDs (aspirin) because of bleeding while on aspirin 625 mg 
TID. He should continue the colchicine for 3 months after ___ 
(start date) and prednisone until follow up with his 
cardiologist on ___. At that time, recommend 
tapering to prednisone 5 mg for ___ weeks before stopping. 
# Please monitor LFTs and confirm they normalize. Patient's 
atorvastatin, fenofibrate, acetaminophen were held on discharge 
in the setting of elevated LFTs. Please recheck liver function 
tests at next follow up appointment and restart his atorvastatin 
and fenofibrate if they are normal. 
# Please continue to monitor patient's CBC. WBC and Hgb abnormal 
likely due to CLL but remained stable on discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of your ___ 
___.

WHY were you in the hospital?
-He will brought to the emergency room due to low blood 
pressures.
-You were also found to have a fever and there was concern that 
you had an infection.

WHAT happened in the hospital?
-Because of your low blood pressures, you were initially brought 
to the intensive care unit.  There, your breathing improved and 
your blood pressure came up.  You were started on antibiotics 
for possible infection.
-You were also found to have extra fluid, likely due to heart 
failure.
-You were given IV medications to remove this extra fluid, and 
your breathing improved.  The swelling in your legs also 
improved.
-___ transferred to the cardiology floor for further treatment 
of your pericarditis (inflammation around your heart).
-For this, you were treated with high-dose aspirin and your pain 
in the chest greatly improved. Unfortunately, you had some 
bleeding in the sac around your heart and you had to go to the 
ICU again to have a drain placed in that sac to remove the 
fluid. 
- When the drain was removed, you returned to the cardiology 
floor and we continued your prednisone for your pericarditis, 
you had no more chest pain and your rivaroxaban and aspirin were 
restarted 
- In discussion with your oncologist, Dr. ___ decision 
was made to stop your ibrutinib. 

WHAT should you do after leaving the hospital?
-You should take all of your medications as prescribed.
-You should weigh yourself when you get home and then daily, and 
call your doctor if you note weight gain more than 3 pounds.
-You should follow-up with your doctors as listed below.

We wish you the best,
Your ___ care team

suddenly at 5:30 in the morning on ___.  It is similar to his
previous presentation of pericarditis.

Patient was recently in the hospital for 3 weeks for a
pericarditis flare.  He was discharged on ___, and felt
very well throughout the weekend.  On ___, he was getting up
from bed to go to the bathroom when he felt the sudden onset of
sharp substernal chest pain, with radiation around to both
shoulders and through to the back.  Patient describes the pain 
as
similar to his prior pericarditis flare.  The patient had been
taking Vicodin and a prednisone taper at home; this did not help
with his pain.  His pain is exacerbated by taking a deep breath;
it is not made worse by positional changes.  He denies any
associated symptoms of shortness of breath or syncope.  He did
report palpitations on ___, and for this reason he called EMS

STUDIES
-------
___ TTE
Suboptimal image quality. Trivial posterior pericardial effusion 
without echo evidence of tamponade. Aortic regurgitation is 
present. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta. Mild left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal biventricular systolic function. 
Findings c/w hypertensive heart disease. A left pleural effusion 
is present. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
the pericardial effusion is likley similar. This was a complete 
study with additional findings as noted, but still limited by 
image quality.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease 
(status post mid LAD PCI in ___, sick sinus syndrome status 
post pacemaker, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, 
type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin, and recent admission for 
pericarditis who presented with substernal chest pain similar to 
his most recent admission with pericarditis. Patient's exam 
generally unremarkable, with normal blood pressures and good 
mentation. Labs notable for a negative troponin and EKG without 
acute changes. Hospital course complicated by hyponatremia, 
hyperkalemia, and hyperglycemia.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============

#Chest pain
#Pericarditis
His chest pain on presentation was very similar to his most 
recent presentation of pericarditis. In the absence of troponin 
elevation and EKG changes, this was likely a recurrent 
pericarditis flare. No evidence of recurrent pericardial 
effusion on TTE ___. He was recently discharged on a 
prednisone taper and taking 10 mg daily prior to admission. The 
patient received prednisone 40 mg in the emergency room on ___ 
with plan to continue prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days followed 
by a slower steroid taper. Pantoprazole was continued for GI 
prophylaxis. Given persistently recurring chest pain and 
inability to give NSAIDs in the setting of CAD status post PCI 
___, aspirin was increased to 320 mg daily for 2 weeks with 
plan for subsequent decrease back to 81 mg daily (the patient 
may continue taking 320 mg daily for pain as needed). Colchicine 
twice daily was continued. Chest pain resolved within 1 day of 
admission. Follow up with cardiology is recommended.

#Hyponatremia
The patient presented with hypoosmolar hyponatremia to 120 which 
was asymptomatic (exacerbated by initial blood glucose of 220. 
Urine lytes were notable for Na of 43. Given euvolemia on exam 
his hyponatremia was most likely secondary to SIADH in the 
setting of acute pain from pericarditis. A.m. cortisol level low 
in the setting of current treatment with prednisone as above. 
TSH not significantly elevated. Patient was placed on fluid 
restriction of 1.5 L daily and his sodium subsequently increased 
to 128. The patient was educated to continue with the daily 
fluid restriction until he follows up with his primary care 
physician. Follow up within ___ weeks is recommended to ensure 
normalization of hyponatremia.
-Discharge serum sodium: 128

#Hyperkalemia
The patient's potassium during his hospital stay was increased 
to 5.7, asymptomatic. Etiology remains unclear, hyperlipidemia 
as below possibly contributing. No evidence of acute kidney 
injury. Potassium normalized to his baseline with treatment of 
hypoglycemia as below.
-Discharge serum potassium: 4.5

#Type II diabetes mellitus, insulin dependent
#Hyperlipidemia
Patient was initially continued on his home insulin regimen with 
75 units of glargine twice daily plus an insulin sliding scale. 
However, his blood sugars are persistently elevated to 260-360 
with the increased prednisone dose. ___ was consulted to 
assist with further management recommended an increase of his 
insulin sliding scale. His glargine was changed to 75 qAM and 
30qHS (due to hypoglycemia) with sliding scale with meals. He 
received diabetes education and was discharged with a glucometer 
(his home one was broken) for daily blood sugar measurement and 
instructions to monitor his BG closely as his prednisone 
tapered.

#Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
Mildly hyperkalemic on presentation. He was given an additional 
dose of 20 mg IV Lasix with good urine output. His home Lasix 
was increased to 20 mg every day. Discharge weigth 118.4kg 
(261.02 lbs).
-Increased Lasix 20 mg to daily.
-Continued Metoprolol Succinate XL 150 mg PO DAILY 
-Continued Rivaroxaban 20 mg p.o. with dinner.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================

#CAD status post LAD PCI
-Continue baby aspirin

#Obstructive sleep apnea

#History of schizoaffective disorder
-Home divalproex, fluoxetine, ziprasidone.

#CLL:
His ibrutinib was stopped on the last hospital stay given 
bleeding risk and pericardial effusion. 
-Continued to hold ibrutinib

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

Why was I admitted to the hospital?
- you had worsening of your chest pain from the pericarditis. 
Your steroid dose and your aspirin were increased. Imaging of 
your heart did not show any evidence of recurrent fluid around 
your heart.
- your salt level was low. This was likely because of you were 
drinking a lot of water. The amount of water you were drinking 
per day was decreased and your salt levels increased
- your blood sugar was high and therefore your insulin was 
increased.

What should I do after discharge?
- please take all the medications as detailed below. 
Specifically, take 325mg aspirin daily for the next two weeks. 
After that you should go back to 81mg daily (a baby aspirin) but 
you can take 325 daily if you still have pain (for up to two 
more weeks)
- please do not drink more than 1.5l of fluid per day until you 
see your PCP to keep your salt levels steady
- please use the glucometer to measure your blood sugar daily 
and record the results. Please show them to your PCP when you 
follow up with him
- please call your PCP if your blood sugars are <80 or >200 for 
assistance with changing your insulin dose. 
- please follow up with your PCP and your cardiologist as below.

All the best,

Your ___ care team!

====================
ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================

# Fever
# Non-productive cough
Presented with one day history of fever (103), sore throat, 
intermittent dry cough, general body aches and mild shortness of 
breath. Wife with similar symptoms in the days preceding 
symptoms, which had subsequently resolved. Patient had flu 
vaccine this season. Took Tylenol with some improvement in 
fever, but given persistence greater than 100.3F, presented to 
ED. Examination with clear lungs bilaterally and no evidence of 
fluid overload. Labs were unremarkable. CXR without evidence of 
infiltrates/consolidation. As symptoms were most likely 
consistent with a viral syndrome, patient was treated 
symptomatically and started on five day course of levofloxacin 
to prevent bacterial superinfection. Total IgG levels >500. 
Influenza swab negative and respiratory viral culture negative. 
Symptoms gradually improved and resolved over the course of the 
admission. Patient left AMA, understanding all risks to him 
leaving.

# UTI
# ___
Baseline creatinine ~1.0. Acute rise prior to transfer to FICU, 
with poor urine output over the previous 12 hours. Most likely 
etiology included pre-renal vs. ATN, in the setting of 
hypovolemia and hypotension. However, patient was on many 
medications which could have precipitated ___, including 
colchicine, losartan and acyclovir. These medications were held, 
but restarted prior to discharge, as creatinine returned to 
baseline following administration of 2L IVF in FICU. Patient 
also noted to have dirty UA, with subsequent urine culture 
positive for yeast >100,000 CFU/ml. Started fluconazole 200mg 
daily for 14 days. Patient left AMA, understanding all risks to 
him leaving.

# Atrial flutter
Patient with a background history of atrial fibrillation/flutter 
with RVR. On previous admission required transfer to CCU for 
rate management in the setting of pericardial effusion, and 
subsequent tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis. Flipped into 
atrial flutter with rates 140-150s on ___. Minimal response to 
PO/IV diltiazem and PO metoprolol. Patient remained asymptomatic 
but given hypotension, with systolic blood pressure readings in 
the ___, patient was transferred to ICU for rate control. Here 
he received 2L IVF and was loaded with IV amiodarone, with 
subsequent normalization of rates and pressures. Remained stable 
on the floor, on fractionated metoprolol 37.5mg Q6H, before 
transitioning to home regimen of metoprolol succinate 150mg 
daily prior to discharge. 

# CLL
# Lymphocytosis
Diagnosed in ___, unfavorable cytogenetics by virtue of 
deletion(17p), previously on ibrutinib and has completed four 
cycles of EP, but now off ibritnib therapy given recent 
admission for pericardial effusion and hypotension. Patient was 
scheduled for admission ___ to initiate therapy with 
venetoclax. This was deferred given current infective process 
and will be commenced at a later date. Continued home acyclovir 
for prophylaxis.

======================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================

# Type II Diabetes Mellitus
Continued home insulin glargine regimen, but eased back on 
Humalog ISS on admission. Blood sugars remained controlled. 

# HFrEF
Continued furosemide 20mg every other day initially for preload 
reduction and losartan 25mg daily for afterload reduction, 
however given acute rise in creatinine on ___, furosemide and 
losartan were both held. NHBK was initially achieved with 
fractionated metoprolol, but given atrial flutter changes were 
made as above. Given normalization of creatinine and heart 
rates, patient was transitioned back to the above medications 
prior to discharge.

# Atrial Fibrillation
Continued rivaroxaban while inpatient. Temporarily transitioned 
to heparin drip given acute rise in creatinine, but restarted 
rivaroxaban with improvement in renal function. Rate control 
management was achieved with control of atrial flutter as above, 
before transitioning back to home regimen of metoprolol. 

# CAD status post LAD PCI
# Hyperlipidemia
Patient was transitioned back to aspirin 81mg daily from aspirin 
325mg daily, given resolution of pericarditis symptoms. 
Atorvastatin and fenofibrate had been held on a previous 
admission. The decision if/when to restart these is deferred to 
outpatient providers. 

# Pericarditis
Continued prednisone taper, but changed colchicine BID to daily 
dosing. 

# Hypertension
Continued home losartan initially, before it was held in the 
setting of ___. Restarted prior to discharge.

# Schizoaffective Disorder
Continued home divalproex, fluoxetine, and ziprasidone.

# Hyponatremia
Stable and chronic. Thought to be some component of SIADH. 
Sodium levels were closely monitored during admission, and 
patient was maintained on a low sodium diet. 

# Anemia
Chronic and stable. Likely due to malignancy.

# Hypothyroidism
Continued home levothyroxine 50mcg daily.

stent, recurrent pericarditis, HFpEF, stroke, HTN/HLD, and 
hypothyroidism, presenting for initiation of venetoclax therapy.

====================
ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================

# Hyponatremia
Patient with a known history of chronic hyponatremia, previously 
thought to contain a component of SIADH. Sodium levels remained 
an issue throughout admission. Acutely decreased in the setting 
of IVF administration, reaching a nadir of 119. Urine/serum 
lytes and osmolality consistent with SIADH. Of note, patient is 
on several psychiatric medications which may contribute to 
chronic hyponatremia. Rapid correction of sodium with IV 
furosemide, with daily diuresis required to maintain sodium 
>130. AM cortisol was within normal limits. As patient required 
IVF during initiation of venetoclax, sodium was closely 
monitored and high dose IV furosemide administered twice daily. 
Patient was also fluid restricted and placed on a low sodium 
diet. Weight down-trended over the course of the admission but 
was still elevated at discharge. Will increase home regimen of 
furosemide to 20mg PO daily from every other day. Sodium 129 
prior to discharge, but this lab was drawn prior to last dose of 
IV furosemide 80mg.

# CLL
Diagnosed in ___, unfavorable cytogenetics by virtue of 
deletion(17p), previously on ibrutinib, but now off ibrutinib 
therapy given recent admission for pericardial effusion and 
hypotension. Presented on this occasion to initiate venetoclax, 
however starting same was delayed in the setting of 
hyponatremia, ___ and altered mental status. Eventually started 
venetoclax 20mg daily on ___, without issue or evidence of 
TLS. Dose was increased to 50mg on ___, and 100mg on ___, 
without any issues. Continued allopurinol (renally dosed during 
___ to prevent hyperuricemia. Also continued acyclovir for HSV 
prophylaxis. 

# Bradycardia
Patient with a known history of sick-sinus syndrome, with a PPM 
in place, and atrial fibrillation, on metoprolol succinate 150mg 
daily. Soon after admission, patient was noted to have heart 
rates in ___ on monitor, which persisted for several hours. EKG 
at the time with normal heart rate in ___. Patient was 
asymptomatic, with the exception of a ""mechanical fall"" without 
injury. Initially rates recovered to ___, but following 
administration of metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg, rates dropped back 
down to ___. EP were consulted; interrogation of the PPM 
revealed a well functioning device, with no documented 
bradycardic episodes. Subsequent telemetry with high PVC burden 
and ventricular bigeminy, but no recurrence of bradycardia. 
These episodes likely represented monitoring error rather than 
true bradycardia.

# Fever
Patient with temperature of 100.3, and subsequently 101 on 
___. Remained asymptomatic and denied all symptoms. CT chest 
demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than 
right, but no evidence of consolidation/infiltration. Urine 
culture was negative. Beta glucan and galactomannan were not 
detected. Respiratory screen and culture also negative. Unclear 
exact etiology but given absence of recurrent fevers and 
hemodynamic stability, antibiotics were not initiated. 

# ___
Patient with apparent baseline creatinine ~1.1. Over the course 
of admission, creatinine fluctuated, reaching a max of 1.9 on 
___. Most likely etiology was venous congestion in the setting 
volume overload. Creatinine returned to baseline on each 
occasion following aggressive diuresis, consistent with this 
hypothesis. 

# Somnolence
Intermittent somnolence noted by nursing staff over the course 
of admission. Unclear etiology; initial concern was for osmotic 
demyelination in setting of rapid
hyponatremia correction, but this was unlikely given normal 
neurological examination and periods of time when he was alert, 
awake and orientated. Another concern was patient 
self-medicating with Vicodin, as was found on two occasions with 
Vicodin on his person, although patient denied same, serum APAP 
level was negative and no respiratory depression was noted. Most 
likely etiology was delirium in setting of metabolic 
derangements. 

# LUE swelling
Patient noted to have left greater than right upper extremity 
swelling by nursing. Unclear exact chronicity, but a small 
difference was notable on examination. Had been anticoagulated 
on rivaroxaban at home, and before transitioning to enoxaparin 
while an inpatient. Factor Xa levels were therapeutic. Patient 
refused US Doppler. There was no further change in swelling 
throughout admission, making DVT less likely.

======================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================

# Type II Diabetes Mellitus
Continued home insulin glargine, with a Humalog insulin sliding 
scale. Adjustments had to be made on a number of occasions, 
given patient's reluctance to eat a restricted diet. Will be 
discharged on admission regimen. 

# HFrEF
Issues with volume persisted throughout admission, and were 
contributors to both ___ and hyponatremia. Home furosemide was 
replaced with IV furosemide as needed. Ultimately the patient 
was transitioned to an oral regimen of furosemide 20mg daily. 
Weight was not at admission weight at discharge, but as it was 
the patient's birthday and he was stable, we were happy to 
discharge him with close follow-up. Losartan was held in the 
setting of ___, and will be held on discharge. The decision 
if/when to restart is deferred to outpatient providers. 
Metoprolol, fractionated from home dose, was continued, except 
as noted above. 

# Atrial Fibrillation
Rivaroxaban was held given potential interaction with 
venetoclax, and therapeutic enoxaparin started in its place. 
Home metoprolol was fractionated, and continued at 37.5mg Q6H, 
except as noted above. Following discussion, the decision was 
made to restart rivaroxaban on discharge, as the risk of further 
thromboembolism was felt to outweigh the risk of bleeding.

# CAD status post LAD PCI
# Hyperlipidemia
Continues aspirin 81mg daily. On previous admission, both statin 
and fenofibrate were held. Decision if/when to restart these 
medications is deferred to outpatient provider. 

# Pericarditis
Colchicine was discontinued, given theoretical interaction with 
venetoclax.

# Hypertension
Home losartan 25mg daily was held in the setting of labile renal 
function during the course of admission. It was held on 
discharge; decision if/when to restart is deferred to outpatient 
providers. 

# Schizoaffective Disorder
Cotninued home divalproex, fluoxetine, and ziprasidone. 
Discussion should be had with outpatient psychiatrist if these 
medications may be contributing to chronic hyponatremia.

# Anemia
Chronic issue, which remained stable during admission. Required 
two blood transfusions while an inpatient. Most likely etiology 
is malignancy induced.

# Hypothyroidism
Continued levothyroxine 50mcg daily. Repeat TSH was 19, with a 
normal free T4. Discussed with endocrinology, who recommended 
repeating TSH after ___ to obtain an accurate reflection if 
current dosing is correct.  

# Chronic pain
Continued gabapentin 300mg TID, dose adjusted during times of 
acute kidney injury. Home vicodin was replaced with APAP and 
oxycodone while an inpatient. Will be discharged on gabapentin 
300mg BID (renally dosed)

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with high risk CLL on venetoclax, 
insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, history of left sided 
cerebrovascular accident, depression with psychotic features, 
reported history of conversion disorder, hypothyroidism, 
hypertension, who was admitted with left-sided weakness and 
diminished sensation in the setting of hypoglycemia and 3 days 
of vertigo. CT head negative, CTA head and neck with no thrombus 
on admission. MRI Brain performed without acute findings. His 
symptoms gradually resolved over the course of his stay and he 
was discharged with outpatient ___. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
==================
[ ] Follow up hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine dose increase ___ 
from 75mcg to 100mcg, after lab findings of elevated TSH (28) 
and low free T4 (0.7). Needs repeat TSH/FT4 in ___ weeks 
[ ] Follow up on neurological symptoms. His L sided weakness and 
sensory deficits had resolved by time of discharge 
[ ] F/u blood glucose, he was discharged on his home ___ 
___ at meals with ISS per ___
[ ] For his MRI, his freestyle ___ was removed. He may require 
replacement as an outpatient. 
[ ] Follow up re: BPPV symptoms. 
[ ] Follow up re: L forearm-hand peripheral neuropathy, 
alleviated by capsaicin cream. He was continued on gabapentin 
600mg BID as an inpatient. 
[ ] Follow up on joint/tailbone pain, exacerbated by poor 
weather. 
[ ] Follow up uric acid level. He was given 1 dose of 
allopurinol at discharge after his AM labs showed uric acid 7.5. 
Will need repeat level at next appointment. 
[] Discharge weight 296lbs (134Kg), increased throughout 
hospitalization. Follow up weight, consider increasing dose of 
daily Lasix if needed

ACUTE ISSUES
============
#L sided weakness, numbness
#L homonymous hemianopsia
#H/o prior CVA
Presented with left-sided weakness and diminished sensation. No 
acute stroke was seen on CT/CTA imaging, despite what would be a 
large territory infarct given profound ipsilateral facial and 
upper and lower extremity symptoms. Neurology was consulted and 
had low suspicion for new event. Hypoglycemia was considered, as 
this can cause recrudescence of stroke symptoms; however, his 
symptoms persisted even with correction of blood sugar. B12 and 
TSH/T4 were also obtained; he was noted to be somewhat 
hypothyroid, even with medications, and we increased his dosage 
from 75mcg to 100mcg. He was placed on telemetry; no events were 
noted. With approval from our EP team and his outpatient 
cardiologist, an MRI brain was performed, with read notable for 
no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, mass, or edema. He 
continued to work with our ___ team. His symptoms gradually 
resolved throughout his stay, with full upper extremity strength 
at discharge and waxing/waning ability to walk on his LLE. There 
was low concern for an acute stroke or TIA; the primary team, 
neurology, and psychiatry found that his presentation is most 
consistent with functional neurologic disorder, with possible 
recrudescence of stroke symptoms given hypoglycemia and low 
thyroid. He should follow up as an outpatient for further 
management of symptoms. 

#Hypoglycemia in setting of Insulin-dependent Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus 
His A1c in ___ was 8.7%. His home insulin regimen is 70/30, 
100 units 3 times daily. He was reportedly taking in much less 
p.o. in the setting of his persistent vertigo, which may explain 
his hypoglycemia. No symptoms of other common causes of 
hypoglycemia, eg infection or adrenal insufficiency, were found. 
No insulin was given on admission, and he was started on 50% of 
his dose the next morning. ___ was consulted 
and his insulin regimen was adjusted per their recommendations. 
His home metformin was held but restarted on discharge. His 
discharge regimen was home ___ ___ at meals with ISS 
per ___. 

#Anxiety
Psychiatry was consulted regarding his increasing anxiety, and 
were also made aware of his ongoing symptoms, potentially 
contributing to his anxiety. He was given lorazepam prn for 
acute anxiety events. 

#Diabetic neuropathy
He noted exacerbation of L sided neuropathy from fingers to mid 
forearm. He was given capsaicin cream prn to good effect, and 
did not note further symptoms throughout the rest of his stay. 
He also continued on his home gabapentin. 

#BPPV
He noted worsening vertigo the day prior to discharge, similar 
but reduced in intensity as compared to previous events. He 
noted that he had been given meclizine prior to good effect. He 
stated that he felt okay to move around, with the main symptom 
being that he saw double if something was held close to his 
face. He was given meclizine. He was able to ambulate without 
issues at time of discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#Depression
He was continued on home ziprasidone.

#CLL
He brought in his venetoclax from home, and was continued on his 
regimen. He was given allopurinol on discharge given a slight 
increase in uric acid levels. 

#HTN
Continued on home losartan and metoprolol. He was also continued 
on home furosemide with furosemide prn for ___ edema and increase 
weight. He should follow up as an outpatient for weight check 
and possible uptitration of Lasix.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE 
================================= 
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman w/ history of CLL (on venetoclax), 
depression with psychotic features, GERD, single remote episode 
of pancreatitis, IDDM, CAD s/p PCI, roux-en-y gastric bypass & 
cholecystectomy, & hypothyroidism who presented with acute 
onset, severe epigastric pain. CTA A/P, lab work & cardiac 
workup were all unrevealing. Mr. ___ was evaluated by GI and 
underwent EGD, which revealed a healing jejunal ulcer as well as 
a ___ fistula. His home PPI was made BID and Mr. ___ 
was provided with low dose oxycodone prn for pain management. 
Course was complicated by periods of lethargy and delirium. His 
levothyroxine was titrated up as his recent TSH was elevated and 
concern this was contributing to his lethargy. Mr. ___ was also 
seen by psychiatry, who assisted in medication adjustments. Over 
the course of his hospitalization, Mr. ___ mental status 
waxed and waned, likely due to his underlying medical issues and 
medication titration, however at discharge his mental status was 
back to baseline and clear. Course was further complicated by

oncology ward for further care. 

On arrival to medical ward patient was lethargic but arousable 
to
voice and clearly oriented. However, he had difficulty staying
awake during the interview, as he had received 1mg of IV 
Dilaudid
in ED several hours prior. He noted that he did not feel
lethargic prior to receiving IV Dilaudid. As a result of his
sedation, a full history and PAML could not be obtained.

of 2.2, and BP to mid ___ during stay. He was given IVF and 
blood
pressure rebounded and stayed normal thereafter. Bladder scan
revealed >500cc so foley was placed and UA was not consistent

ACUTE CONDITIONS
========================

#Acute Abdominal Pain (Improved):
#Presumed Complicated UTI:
#Urinary Retention (resolved)
___ (resolved)
#Hematuria:
Patient with suprapubic tenderness at OSH, occurred in setting 
of
acute urinary retention which corresponds to location of lower
abdominal pain. Significant improvement after foley placement.
However, noted worsening of abdominal pain on ___ which
prompted further imaging with CT A/P. Alternate cause could be
due to recent jejunal ulcer vs. known gastric fistula causing
intra-abdominal complication that was diagnosed via CT scan and
EGD last admission on ___ (less likely as abdomen is benign
currently). Urinalysis grossly positive from ___ therefore,
initiated ceftriaxone. However, culture negative. Given UA
results on admission, presenting symptoms and high risk for
infection in s/o CLL and treatment, decision was made to 
continue
a course of ceftriaxone but extended to a ___s would
be a complicated UTI. CT A/P ___ does not show an acute
intra-abdominal process but noted gastrogastric fistula or 
bypass
reversal (not new and unlikely to cause his pain). Also, 
consider
role of constipation as possible cause of abdominal discomfort 
and retention. 
-Lactate unremarkable at 0.9. 
-Renal U/S negative ___

#CLL: Patient had recurrence of night sweats and noted to have 
an
increase in his white blood cell count with prominent
lymphocytosis, consistent with relapsing disease. Given these
changes, he was started on ibrutinib. However, given multiple
significant bleeding events (GI bleeding and pericardial bleed),
further ibrutinib therapy was deferred and venetoclax was
initiated. In the setting of active infection concern, 
venetoclax
was held but now restarted on ___ per primary oncologist.

GASTROINTESTINAL: Small hiatal hernia, the stomach is 
unremarkable.  A 
surgical clip is adjacent lesser curvature of the stomach, 
possibly secondary a dropped clip during prior cholecystectomy. 
Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, 
and enhancement throughout. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon 
is noted, without evidence of wall thickening or fat stranding. 
The appendix is not visualized. 
  
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
There is no free fluid in the pelvis. 
  
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate and seminal vesicles are 
grossly 
unremarkable. 
  
LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
=================
___ with CLL (on venetoclax) with history of depression with 
psychotic features, T2DM, stroke, s/p gastric bypass and 
cholecystectomy who presented with lower abdominal pain and 
difficulty urinating. Patient was able to void normally with 
PVRs < 50 cc without intervention. Workup for cause of abdominal 
pain was unrevealing.

ACUTE ISSUES
=============
#Acute Abdominal Pain
Patient reported severe lower abdominal pain which he stated was 
similar to his most recent admission during which he was treated 
for a UTI. UA, however, revealed no evidence of infection. In 
addition, CT AP was performed which also did not reveal a cause 
for the patient's pain. Recent CTA revealed no evidence of 
mesenterich ischemia. Recent EGD revealed a healing duodenal 
ulcer for which the patient had been placed on BID PPI. He 
stated this pain was unlike his ulcer pain. He remained 
hemodynamically stable and pain was well-controlled with his 
home regimen of oxycodone, PPI, and Carafate prior to discharge.

#Urinary retention
Patient reported suprapubic tenderness and had a temperature of 
100.2. He was initially treated empirically with cefepime. UA 
however, had no evidence of infection and antibiotics were 
stopped. In addition, the patient was able to void spontaneously 
and had PVRs < 50 mls. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
#CLL: Patient had recurrence of night sweats and noted to have 
an increase in his white blood cell count with prominent 
lymphocytosis, consistent with relapsing disease. Given these 
changes, he was started on ibrutinib. However, given multiple
significant bleeding events (GI bleeding and pericardial bleed), 
further ibrutinib therapy was deferred and venetoclax was 
initiated. In the setting of active infection concern, 
venetoclax was held but now restarted on ___ per primary
oncologist. 
- Continued venetoclax 400mg daily

part
of a physical for a new job. A CT was obtained which revealed an
aneurysm of the distal arch and proximal descending thoracic
aorta.  She has no family history of aneurysm or connective
tissue disease. Of note, she was involved in a small motor
vehicle accident in ___ where she was the driver and struck the
car in front of her that had bounced off the median strip. She
was then struck by the car behind her. She was wearing a 
seatbelt
and the airbag did not deploy. She was not injured enough to
warrant hospitalization. Interestingly, she had an 
echocardiogram
done several months earlier for a heart murmur which was read as
normal. She denies any chest pain, upper back pain, dyspnea or
palpitations. She presents today for surgical evaluation for
repair of her distal arch/descending thoracic aneurysm.

systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. 
A large aneurysm is noted at the level of the left subclavian 
takeoff. The remainder of the descending aorta is of normal 
caliber.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

POSTBYPASS:
The patient is in sinus rhythm on titrated phenylephrine 
infusion. Biventricular function is maintained. Valves remain 
unchanged. The ascending aorta remains intact. The native 
descending aorta remains intact. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented on the day of surgery and underwent a open 
repair of aortic arch/descending thoracic aortic
aneurysm with left subclavian artery bypass.  Because of the 
location and the complexity, 2 surgeons from different 
specialties, Cardiac Surgery and Vascular Surgery, were 
required.  Please refer to the operative report for details of 
the surgery. The operation went successfully and there was a 
good pulse in the subclavian and the distal aorta that was equal 
to the pulse in the ascending/arch.   Small ___ drain was 
placed into the pericardium and exited the chest wall as well as 
2 additional chest tubes within the left chest. The patient was 
then taken to the ICU intubated in stable condition.  She was 
extubated soon after transfer to the ICU.  On POD1, she had 
difficulty tolerating pain. Epidural was placed as recommended 
by acute pain service. She was also persistently tachycardic and 
was started on metoprolol with good control. She was weaned off 
all pressors by POD1. On POD2, her chest tube and JP drains were 
discontinued and her diet was advanced. She received gentle 
diuresis and was transferred to the floor. Her foley was 
discontinued without event on POD3. Her epidural was attempted 
to be removed on POD3 however was found to be retained in the 
skin per spine X-ray and had to be removed under fluoroscopy by 
the acute pain service.  She was well transitioned to oral pain 
medication and ambulated with frequent physical therapy. By 
POD5, metoprolol was discontinued and patient received more 
diuresis. She continued to recover without event. By POD6, 
patient's pain was well controlled on PO pain medications, she 
was hemodynamically stable with normal labs, was ambulating and 
voiding without difficulty. She expressed full comfort in 
continuing her recovery at home with the help of her family. She 
received adequate counseling regarding the importance of 
ambulation and adequate PO intake. All her questions were 
answered. She is to follow up with Dr. ___ at his 
clinic as shown in her discharge instructions.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with hx of poorly-controlled DMII and right foot ulcers 
presenting with LLE cellulitis persisting after underdosing his 
oral clindamycin.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Cellulitis: Improved on IV vancomycin. Cellulitis was likely 
undertreated on his  oral clindamycin therapy given that he was 
only taking ___ of the prescribed dose mistakenly. Given his 
clinical stability and improvement in LLE cellulitis, he was 
transitioned to po doxycycline for course of ___ additional days 
with continued improvement of cellulitis prior to discharge.

# Right foot ulcers: Stable based on exam and recent podiatry 
note. Maintained wrapped in gauze and with pressure-relieving 
pad in place on foot. No change in ulcer that would necessitate 
inpatient podiatry consult. Follow-up as outpatient with 
podiatry.

# Hyponatremia: Falsely decreased due to marked hyperglycemia, 
corrected to 135 when hyperglycemic and normalized when 
normoglycemic. Asymptomatic.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# CKD: Mild creatinine elevation on admission returned to 
baseline in mid-1s, likely was related to both hyperglycemia 
with osmotic diuresis and pre-renal etiology along with 
concurrent infection.

# DMII, poorly-controlled: Presentation of FSBG >500 likely 
secondary to both underlying cellulitis along with dietary 
non-compliance given his significant gatorade consumption. Did 
not have widened anion gap. Continued on his home Lantus 40 
units and covered with HISS while in-house.

# HLD: Continude home simvastatin.

# HTN: Continued home lisinopril and atenolol.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- outpatient podiatry follow-up for left foot cellulitis and 
right foot ulceration

Discharge Diagnosis:
R foot ulcer
 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).
 
Discharge Instructions:
Please follow these guidelines unless your physician has 
specifically instructed you otherwise. Please call our office 
nurse if you have any questions. Dial 911 if you have any 
medical emergency.

ACTIVITY:

There are restrictions on activity. On your right side you are 
NON WEIGHT BEARING. You should keep this site 
elevated when ever possible (above the level of the heart!) 
Physical therapy worked with you in the hospital and gave 
instructions on weight bearing: please follow these accordingly. 


No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.

PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).

New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.

Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever 
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus 
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these 
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.

Exercise:

Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks.

No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next ___ days.

Try to keep leg elevated when able.

BATHING/SHOWERING:

You may shower immediately upon coming home, but you must keep 
your dressing CLEAN, DRY and INTACT. You can use a shower bag 
taped around your ankle/leg or hang your foot/leg outside of the 

bathtub. 

WOUND CARE:

You will be getting every other day dressing changes by a 
visiting nurse with betadine paint to the ulceration and a dry 
sterile dressing. You may cleanse the foot with peroxide. Once 
the dressing is in place, avoid getting it wet. 

MEDICATIONS:

Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the 
medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a 
new prescription for infection which will be taken every 6 
hours. 

CAUTIONS:

NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is 
an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of 
your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you 
smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse 
or doctor for information on smoking cessation.

If a follow up appointment was not made prior to your discharge, 

please call the office on the first working day after your 
discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This 
should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days 
after discharge. Normal office hours are ___

IMPRESSION:
1. Acute fracture of the head of the ___ metatarsal, with 
lateral 
displacement.
2. Diffuse demineralization of the bones, with significant 
overlying soft tissue swelling raises concern for possible 
osteomyelitis.

-FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT PORT Study Date of ___:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the prior radiographs from 
___ and ___. 
Patient has undergone resection of the majority of the distal 
fourth 
metatarsal as well as of the fourth proximal phalanx.  There 
remains some soft tissue swelling and gas consistent with the 
recent surgery and this is stable. There are postoperative 
changes involving the fifth ray, which are stable. There is a 
large os peronei adjacent to the cuboid.  Spurs about the 
calcaneal tuberosity are present. On the lateral view, there is 
a plantar soft tissue ulcer seen adjacent to the metatarsal 
heads. 

-TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 9:41:11 AM:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal ___ size. Color-flow imaging of the 
interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal 
defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this 
study. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Doppler 
parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic 
function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and 
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or abscess identified. 
Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
===================================================
___ y/o male with PMHx of poorly controlled DM2 (HbA1c ___ was 
13.6), HTN, HLD presented with infected diabetic foot ulcer and 
sepsis.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
===================================================
# Diabetic foot ulcer: Patient presented with a chronic foot 
ulcer of his right foot. He had been seen ___ clinic earlier that 
day and labs drawn were significant for a leukocytosis; he was 
thus sent to the ED for evaluation. ___ the ED initial vitals 
were: ___ 99%. He spiked a fever to 102.5. Labs 
were significant for WBC of 17.7 with 90% PMNs, Na of 126, Cr of 
2.1, glucose ___ 500s. Lactate 1.4. He was placed on 
vanc/cipro/flagyl. Podiatry performed bedside I&D on ___. Blood 
cultures grew group B strep, group G strep. These also grew out 
of wound cultures; MSSA also grew out of the wound. He was taken 
back to the OR for further I&D on ___ and ___. Surface ECHO 
was performed and negative for any mass or vegetation. WBC 
trended down, though did have slight uptrend prior to discharge 
(14.2 on day of discharge). He was hemodynamically stable 
throughout his stay. He was discharged on ertapenem 1g q24hrs at 
home, to be taken for another 6-weeks, with stop date of 
___.

# Type 2 diabetes: uncontrolled, last HbA1c was 13.6 
(___). Patient was placed on his home medication which was 
Lantus 40units qAM. Initially his FSBGs were high, requiring 
large amounts of sliding scale correction at mealtimes. However 
as his infection was controlled, his FSBGs were less that 200. 
Given that not much adjustment was made to his insulin from 
home, yet his sugars were much better controlled than his HbA1c 
suggested, it was thought that his dietary discretion at home 
may be playing a significant role. He was seen by nutrition for 
diet education. He will follow-up with his PCP for further 
titration of his insulin regimen. Given drug interaction, his 
preadmission simvastain was stopped and he was placed on 
atorvastatin 20mg daily. He was continued on his ASA 81mg daily.

# Acute on chronic kidney injury - Cr on admission up to 2.1 
from baseline ~1.4-1.6. Likely due to hypovolemia from sepsis as 
has improved with IVFs and ABx. At discharge his Cr was 1.7.

# HTN: Prior to admission the patient was maintained on atenolol 
and lisinopril. His antihypertensives were intitially held due 
to severe infection. He was eventually placed back on lisinopril 
and uptitrated to 10mg daily. Additionally he was started on 
amlodipine 5mg daily. His atenolol was held given his CKD. His 
BPs were maintained at SBP 120-130s on this regimen.

# Anemia: Review of records show baseline Hbg of around 10. Labs 
from ___ consistent with chronic inflammation, which is likely 
still the case given his chronic ulcers and current 
osteomyelitis. Hbg remained stable at ___ during this 
hospitalization.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================================================
- Lisinopril was increased from 5mg to 10mg daily.
- Atenolol was stopped.
- Amlodipine was started at 5mg daily.
- Simvastatin was changed to atorvastatin 20mg daily (given 
interaction between simvastatin and amlodipine).
- He was discharged on 40units Lantus qAM. He will need to 
monitor his FSBGs and likely need insulin adjustment as an 
outpatient based on his dietary pattern.
- Discharged on Ertapenem 1g q24hrs, with stop date of 
___. All questions regarding outpatient parenteral 
antibiotics should be directed to the Infectious Disease RNs at 
___.
- Needs weekly lab draw (CBC with differential, BUN/Cr, AST/ALT, 
Alk Phos, Total bili, ESR/CRP). Results should be faxed to 
Infectious Disease RNs at ___.
- Weight-bearing to right heel.
- Wound needs daily dressing change. Betadine wash, with dry 
___ and ___ wrap.
- Right PICC line placed ___. This can be removed once 
treatment is completed.

admitted with significant leukocytosis, tachycardia, AGMA, and 
acute on chronic renal failure concerning for sepsis secondary 
to bacteremia on ___.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
================
# Sepsis secondary to Strep Viridans Bacteremia: 
Patient presented with increased lower extremity pain, 
leukocytosis to 24,000, tachycardia, malaise, and severe 
metabolic acidosis. He was treated with Vancomycin 1000mg IV 
q48hr, MetRONIDAZOLE 500mg IV q8hr, Ciprofloxacin 400mg IV q12hr 
from ___ to ___. Blood cultures revealed Strep Viridans 
Bacteremia, broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued and 
patient was started on CefTRIAXone 2 gram IV q24hr. Foot XR did 
not indicate osteomyelitis secondary to foot ulcer. No evidence 
of cellulitis on exam. TTE and TEE showed no valvular 
vegetations as source for bacteremia. CT abdomen/pelvis shows no 
clear source of infection. Hip XR shows no evidence of 
osteomyelitis. Right hip joint fluid analysis (___) 
demonstrates ~30,000 WBCs, ___ RBCs, 94% PMNs, no bacteria on 
gram stain, no culture growth. Given that cultures can be 
negative after antibiotic treatment, hip is likely source of 
infection. Hip joint washout deferred for 4-week course of 
ceftriaxone ___. Symptoms have improved and on discharge 
WBC 11.9.

# ___ on CKD: 
Patient had severely increased creatinine of 5.7 from baseline 
of ___ on admission. Etiology undetermined, but there is likely 
a prerenal component from poor perfusion in the setting of poor 
PO intake and sepsis. Prolonged poor perfusion could have 
resulted in ATN. Additionally, the patient was prescribed 
standing Naproxen 500 mg BID for the two weeks prior to 
admission, which may have caused AIN. Patient was given 2L 
normal saline for fluid resuscitation, home Labetalol 100 mg PO 
BID was restarted to restore renal perfusion, Naproxen was held 
during the hospital stay, and patient received sodium bicarb 
with improvements in creatinine. He was placed on a low K low 
phosphate diet. Kidney function returned to baseline on 
discharge.

# Diarrhea:
Patient began to experience several watery bowel movements daily 
while hospitalized. Patient had been on Senna/Colace PRN and 
Oxycodone for pain. He had also been on broad spectrum 
antibiotics for 3 days. C diff negative. CT showed right-sided 
inguinal and pelvic lymphadenopathy of unknown etiology. Last 
colonoscopy ___ years ago, normal. Stool cultures for various 
infectious causes were unrevealing. Cause of diarrhea is likely 
broad spectrum antibiotics and ceftriaxone. Diarrhea resolved 
with Loperamide 2 mg PO TID. 

# Right hip pain: 
On admission, patient describes muscular pain around his right 
groin, as if he pulled a muscle, that did not improve 
substantially despite treatment with Oxycodone and Tylenol. The 
pain is worse when he moves the RLE, and consequently prevents 
him from ambulating. Hip XR demonstrates OA changes without 
evidence of osteomyelitis. CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrates 
inguinal hernia and lymphadenopathy. Joint hip aspiration 
demonstrates large WBC with PMN predominance, likely infectious. 
Less likely inflammatory given monoarticular joint pain and lack 
of associated disease in medical history. Treatment as per 
sepsis above.

# Anemia: 
Patient has a history of anemia. Iron studies demonstrated low 
iron with elevated ferritin and low transferrin concerning for 
anemia of chronic disease or acute inflammatory suppression. CKD 
also contributing. Hgb dropped below 7.0 several times, blood 
transfusion given and prematurely discontinued due to reaction 
during first transfusion. During subsequent transfusions, 
patient was given Benadryl prior and experienced no 
complications. Current Hgb 7.6. 

# Tranfusion Reaction:
Patient had a transfusion reaction related to blood transfusion 
for anemia on ___. He received most of his transfusion prior to 
the reaction. Tranfusion discontinued and patient was treated 
with Benadryl. Likely febrile nonhemolytic reaction, given 
symptoms of tremulousness, fever, tachycardia, and hypertension 
with lack of hematuria, back pain, and otherwise negative ROS to 
support hemolytic reaction. Hemolysis labs did not show evidence 
of hemolysis. Patient received Benadryl prior to subsequent 
transfusions and was asymptomatic.

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis: 
Patient had an anion gap of 23 despite a normal lactate on 
admission with delta/delta 1.2 indicating pure anion gap 
metabolic acidosis. Cause is likely multifactorial given history 
of CKD, ___ on admission, and diarrhea while hospitalized. He 
was treated with Sodium bicarb. Metabolic acidosis resolved by 
discharge.

# Tachycardia:
Initially presented with tachycardia, likely in setting of 
ongoing pain, sepsis, and antihypertensive home medication hold 
(amlodipine, Labetalol) for suspected pre-renal ___. S1Q3T3 
pattern seen on EKG, however this pattern is consistent with 
prior EKGs. Old EKG's show patient is typically in sinus 
tachycardia. We restarted home Labetalol and amlodipine with 
resolution of his tachycardia. 

# Right leg pain/swelling: 
Patient complains of RLE pain on admission partially reminiscent 
of diabetic neuropathic foot pain, but also with new ""muscular"" 
groin pain. US w/ Doppler shows no evidence of DVT or arterial 
stenosis/hypoperfusion. Pain likely due to right foot ulcer or 
DM neuropathy. We treated him with Oxycodone ___ mg q4hr prn 
and Tylenol ___ mg po q8hr for pain with improvement in his 
pain from admission. He was resistant to a trial of Gabapentin.

# Hyponatremia: 
Patient was hyponatremic on admission. Etiology is likely 
multifactorial. Extra-renal causes are possible in the setting 
of poor PO intake. Urine lytes indicate inadequate reabsorption 
of sodium given his hyponatremic state possibly due to advanced 
renal failure and inability of the urine to appropriately 
re-uptake sodium. Pain causing SIADH may have contributed, 
though this is less likely given his improved pain control. 
Hyponatremia has resolved on discharge.

# Type 2 DM c/b neuropathy and nephropathy: 
Patient was hyperglycemic on presentation. He was treated with 
Glargine and Humalog. Continued home aspirin and atorvastatin 
while hospitalized.

# Hypertension: 
Home amlodipine and Labetalol were held on admission with 
concerns for ___ secondary to hypoperfusion. Patient was 
tachycardic on presentation, and remained tachycardic despite 
treatment of sepsis. We restarted home Labetalol and amlodipine 
with resolution of his tachycardia.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your time at ___.

Why was I here?
- You had a whole body infection in your bloodstream (sepsis)
- You had damage to your kidneys possibly caused by a few 
things, including the infection, the Naproxen, and not 
eating/drinking enough

What happened while I was here?
- We treated you with antibiotics for your infection
- We searched for an infection source by examining your heart 
with ultrasound, your foot with an X-ray, your abdomen and 
pelvis with CT scan, and your hip with fluid aspiration. We 
think the hip was the source of your infection
- We gave you fluid and medications to to help your kidneys. We 
also stopped your Naproxen and changed you to Tylenol to help 
your kidneys. Your kidneys are back to your normal baseline
- We gave you blood transfusions since your blood had low red 
blood cells
- We gave you oxycodone and Tylenol for your foot pain

What should I do?
- It is VERY IMPORTANT that you FINISH your course of 
antibiotics. If not, the infection could come back and put you 
in the hospital again
- Stay well hydrated and control your blood sugars with an 
appropriate diet
- Continue to take your medications as prescribed
- Follow up with your outpatient providers

___ wish you good health!

report) echodensity with mobile components is seen on the LVOT 
side of the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve consistent 
with a vegetation. Trace aortic regurgitation. No abscesses 
appreciated. Dynamic interatrial septum.
Simple atheroma ascending aorta and aortic arch. A ?moderate in 
size (will measure for final report) echodensity with mobile 
components is seen on the LVOT side of the non-coronary cusp of 
the aortic valve consistent with a vegetation. Trace aortic 
regurgitation. No abscesses appreciated. Dynamic interatrial 
septum. Simple atheroma ascending aorta and aortic arch.

Tunneled Dialysis Line Placement ___
IMPRESSION:  
  
Successful placement of a  27cm tip-to-cuff length tunneled 
dialysis line.  The tip of the catheter terminates in the right 
atrium. The catheter is ready for use. 

TTE ___ 
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:   56%
The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (biplane LVEF 56%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a very small pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with low normal global left ventricular systolic 
function. Mild mitral regurgitation. No discrete 
vegetation/abscess identified. Compared with the prior study 
(images reviewed) of ___, the findings are similar

Dialysis Catheter Removal ___
The procedure was performed at bedside. The Left chest tunneled 
line site was cleaned and draped in standard sterile fashion. 1% 
lidocaine was administered around the tube track. The cuff was 
loosened with a bent forceps. The catheter was removed with 
gentle traction while manual pressure was held at the venotomy 
site. Hemostasis was achieved after 5 min of manual pressure. A 
clean sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the 
procedure well. There were no immediate postprocedural 
complications.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#GI BLEED/ANEMIA: No prior history of GI bleed, but confirmed 
prior history of hemorrhoids. No prior EGD or colonoscopy per 
patient history. Did not notice dark or bloody stools until 
arriving to the hospital. No nausea or vomiting and was 
protecting his airway adequately during his hospitalization. 
Given at least 9uPRBC at the outside hospital prior to arrival 
here.  Was given a total of 13uPRBC during his hospitalization 
here, as well as 9u platelets and 9uFFP.  Started on IV 
pantoprazole BID and aminocaproic acid.  Underwent upper 
endoscopy with GI early in his hospital course, for which he was 
intubated.  Upper endoscopy showed old blood in stomach but 
otherwise no acute bleeding source. ___ team took patient down 
for angiography and found no obvious target of bleeding, which 
initially showed no area of active extravasation.  Blood volume 
continued to remain unstable.  

On ___ Pt went again to ___ and underwent a L gastric artery 
embolization.  His bleeding slowed, but he continued to require 
blood transfusions as above.  Subsequent upper endoscopy on 
___ notable for ischemic gastric mucosa.  Pt developed a 
two-pressor requirement (norepinephrine and vasopressin).  He 
was placed on octreotide and desmopressin for splanchnic 
vasoconstriction and improvement of uremic platelet dysfunction 
(see below), respectively.  Per discussion with family, Pt was 
made DNR/DNI and transitioned to comfort-focused care on 
___.  Pt was extubated and passed away on ___.  

#HFrEF:  EF ___ in ___. CVO2 51 and lactate 2.8 on 
admission, likely a combination of severe anemia and borderline 
shock. On clinical examination, appears euvolemic and not in 
acute heart failure.  Initially held his torsemide, metoprolol, 
digoxin, lisinopril and tamsulosin in setting of low BPs and 
___.  
Had fluid overload in setting of multiple blood transfusions, 
which was tolerated due to need to maintain stable blood volume.

#Altered mental status:  Pt was initially sedated for his 
intubation with propofol and pain controlled with fentanyl.  
Taken off propofol on ___ but continued to remain 
unresponsive and unable to follow commands.  CT head on ___ 
demonstrated bilateral cerebellar hemispheric hypodensities, 
concerning for infarct though time course indeterminate.  Amicar 
discontinued in the setting of possible ischemic event.  

#Atrial fibrillation with RVR: INR goal ___ given frequent 
episodes of supratherapeutic INR. On warfarin, supratherapeutic 
INR of 3.6 on initial presentation to OSH.  Reversed at OSH with 
INR 1.4 upon arrival to ___. Warfarin and metoprolol were held 
in setting of active GI bleed and low BPs. 

#Thrombocytopenia:  Dilutional and active consumption of 
platelets likely etiologies. Required frequent transfusions of 
platelets as above to prevent further dilutional 
thrombocytopenia.  Started on desmopressin given rising uremia 
in setting of acute-on-chronic kidney injury to improve platelet 
dysfunction.

#ANION GAP and NON-GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Downtrending bicarb 
in setting of shock + CKD; Lactate initially increased (2.8 on 
admission, to a peak of 3.2) but normalized. Diabetes reasonably 
well controlled. Possible contributors included renal failure, 
hyperchloremia, plus ongoing bloody output from rectal tube.

#HYPERNATREMIA:  Given D5 to replete free water deficit.

#IDDM: Home levemir + novolog. Started on lantus sliding scale 
during hospitalization. 

#ACUTE ON CKD STAGE III-IV: Cr 2.6 on admission with baseline 
around 1.6. Likely prerenal given low BPs and active bleeding. 
Has received volume back with blood and platelet transfusion, 
but with persistent fluid overload in setting of holding 
diuretics.  Creatinine trended up to a peak of 4.3.   

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#COPD: continued home inhalers without changes.

Cl-92* HCO3-27 AnGap-___ year-old MALE with PMHx of HTN, HLD, Insulin dependent DM II, 
moderate COPD, acute on chronic systolic/diastolic CHF and 
critical AS, CKD Stage III-IV (GFR 34) who was admitted in CHF 
exacerbation, diuresed and underwent TAVR ___, then 
transferred to CCU s/p TAVR for post-procedure monitoring.  He 
was transferred back to the general floor on ___.

# Severe aortic stenosis NYHA Class III-IV (EF ___: The 
patient underwent TAVR ___, approach initially through left 
femoral with subsequent left subclavian cut down and placement 
of 29 mm EVOLUT-R-US. Post-TAVR TTE showed well-seated aortic 
valve without significant stenosis or regurgitation. He 
developed a left shoulder hematoma after left subclavian cut 
down; hemostasis was achieved and the patient remained 
neurovascularly intact. He was started on aspirin 81 mg and 
Plavix 75 daily. He was started on Coumadin ___ and was 
given 5 mg for two days, with a rise to 2.6 on ___, he was then 
given 2.5 mg on ___ and his INR was 3.4.  His Coumadin 
continued to be held thereafter.  At the time of this discharge 
summary, it is anticipated that he may likely only need minimal 
Coumadin daily to maintain a therapeutic INR.  This will be 
managed by his PCP on discharge from rehab. The PCP should be 
contacted prior to discharge from rehab to establish ___ 
services and INR management. 

# Hyponatremia: Baseline 122 to 128.  He dropped to 118 while 
hospitalized. His serum and urine Osms were followed and he was 
given gentle fluids as appropriate. Nephrology was consulted. He 
was placed on a tighter fluid restriction (1.2 liters) with 
strict I&O's and daily weights with gradual improvement.  
Nutritional supplements were added on ___ to help with solute 
intake (Glucerna, given his history of insulin dependent 
diabetes).  He rose to 128 on ___.  He was near euvolemic on 
___ with no lower extremity edema and no elevation of JVD. 
 

# ___: Stage III, baseline CR 2.0 which was elevated post 
procedure.  This peaked at 4.0 on ___, and Nephrology was 
involved and closely following from ___.  As noted above, he 
was gently hydrated and felt to have been overdiuresed post 
procedure with tight fluid restriction thereafter and careful 
fluid management, daily weights and I&O's.  He was trending down 
to 3.1 on ___ and will continue to be carefully monitored.  
Creatinine was 2.5 on ___ and improved significantly.  His 
foley catheter was discontinued and he is due to void.  He will 
likely discharge to rehab when he is at or near his baseline 
creatinine, currently expected to be ___.  He will follow 
up with Nephrology in ___ given his CKD.  An 
appointment will be established prior to his discharge from 
___.  He will continue with a fluid restriction, to be 
relaxed to 1.5 liters on discharge, with strict I&O monitoring 
and daily weights.  This should continue at discharge from rehab 
as well.

# Chronic Systolic/Diastolic Heart Failure: He was originally 
admitted for acute on chronic systolic/diastolic heart failure. 
He has a history of multiple recent exacerbations most likely 
secondary to critical AS. CXR on admission showed some signs of 
overload, though he was clinically well. He was not given an 
___ given his CKD. His home dose Metoprolol was 
temporarily replaced with Metoprolol 12.5 mg Q6. He was diuresed 
with Lasix according to fluid status and his diuretic has been 
held while normalizing his renal function and sodium levels.  
His home Digoxin was discontinued on ___ per the Structural 
Heart team.  It was felt he could be better managed for rate 
control with his atrial fibrillation on an increased dose of 
Metoprolol.  This had been increased early in his stay but he 
had some episodes of low blood pressure.  This has since 
stabilized and at the time of this discharge summary, his dose 
of Metoprolol Tartrate has been increased to 25 mg TID.  He 
tolerated this well with stable blood pressures and heart rate 
in the 70's.  He was changed back to long acting Toprol at the 
increased dose of 37.5 mg BID. If his heart rate and blood 
pressure hold, he has room to increase the Toprol to 50 mg if 
needed, his telemetry has remained stable in the ___ the last 
several days. No ___ was added due to his renal 
function.

# Hypercarbia: Patient initially presented with CO2 retention 
after TAVR. His blood gas improved after 1.5 hrs BiPAP. The 
hypercarbia was felt to be secondary to sedation and decreased 
inspiratory effort. He improved clinically and was weaned from 
O2 and BiPAP.

# UTI: Urine culture on ___ grew Ceftriaxone sensitive Proteus; 
Urine cx on ___ was contaminated.  Patient was being treated for 
a presumed UTI with Ceftriaxone in ED x 1. He was started on 
Bactrim (three doses following admission, then started on Cipro 
for two doses) and ultimately restarted on Ceftriaxone x two 
doses which was completed.  No repeat UA was performed.  Was 
also given 3 doses of Bactrim as well. Then received 
ciprofloxacin ___ and ___ 

# Atrial Fibrillation: Poorly controlled with resting rates of 
100 and spikes to 130 with activity while on 25 mg Toprol daily 
at the floor. He was rate controlled with metoprolol 50 XL at 
home, most recently placed on Metoprolol 12.5 Q6 (pt was briefly 
tried on metoprolol 25 QID but had BP decrease on ___. 
CHADS2VASC of 5. On ___ his Digoxin was discontinued per the 
Structural Heart team and his heart rate continued to re-spike 
to the 90's with a stable blood pressure in the 120's systolic.  
At this point he was started on Metoprolol 25 mg TID with a plan 
to transition to Toprol XL 37.5 mg BID at the time of discharge. 
 The patient had been on Eliquis in the past but had episodes of 
epistaxis and elevated creatinine and decline in renal function 
and it was discontinued.  He had been on warfarin in the past 
but was confusing doses in his assisted living facility and his 
INR was difficult to manage. Initially he was anticoagulated 
with ASA 81 mg and Plavix 75mg daily post operatively, and the 
Plavix was ultimately discontinued. He was re-started on 
Coumadin at 5mg on ___ and currently has a supratherapeutic INR 
of 3.4 and his Coumadin has been held.  It is anticipated he 
will not require high doses of Coumadin given his renal function 
and risk of bleeding.  It should continue to be monitored daily 
and titrated to a simple daily dose when his INR stabilized.  He 
will follow up with both his PCP and ___ on discharge 
from rehab.  INR on ___ trending down to 31.3 and 2.8 
respectively with no dose given on ___.
 
# Insulin Dependent DM2: he reports using a sliding scale 
insulin at bedtime with Levemir and a sliding scale which will 
be clarified prior to discharge from ___.  He will 
require close follow up with his PCP at discharge from rehab and 
should have tighter control surrounding his insulin management.  
His home Levemir dose of 2 units for FSBS > 249 at ___ was 
ordered to resume.  He reports episodes of AM hypoglycemia in 
the past and should follow up with his PCP at discharge from 
rehab, with an appointment to be established by rehab prior to 
his discharge there.  He should continue a sliding scale insulin 
___ scale included with his discharge reconciliation) 

#Leukopenia, possibly secondary to Bactrim. He had no signs of 
infection (other than UTI as above) while admitted. This was 
monitored but not intervened upon and normalized to 7.9 on 
___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were short of 
breath. This happened because of tightness of one of your heart 
valves. You underwent evaluation for a transaortic heart valve 
previously and were admitted for a heart valve replacement on 
___. 

You were also treated for a urinary tract infection, which is 
now better. While hospitalized, you had an acute kidney injury 
on your underlying chronic kidney disease, likely due to 
contrast dye from your procedure and multiple medications.  

In addition, you have been noted to have low sodium 
(hyponatremia) at admission and noted in the recent past. You 
were placed on a fluid restriction and a low sodium diet, which 
should continue at discharge.  You were weighed daily and your 
intake and output was closely measured. You were placed on 
nutrition supplements to help with your sodium levels, since you 
are diabetic, this is Glucerna as opposed to Ensure supplements. 
 You should continue with a 1.5 liter fluid restriction 
permanently at discharge, your intake and output measured while 
at rehab and counted when at home.  This includes food that 
melts at room temperature (jello, ice cream, popsicles).  You 
should weigh yourself daily and if your weight goes up ___ lbs 
in one to two days contact your PCP or ___ immediately. 


Nephrology followed you closely while here and given your kidney 
function status, recommend that you follow with an outpatient 
nephrologist.  An appointment has been established for you with 
Dr. ___ at ___.  This will help you to monitor and 
manage your kidney function along with your current other 
medical conditions such as your heart function.  While 
hospitalized, your Digoxin was discontinued and your Metoprolol 
dose was changed. At home you took 25 mg twice Daily, and while 
here it was increased to short acting Metoprolol 25 mg three 
times daily. If your heart rate remains stable, you will be 
discharged on 37.5 mg long acting Toprol twice Daily. Your Lasix 
has been kept on hold following your acute kidney injury and you 
have remained euvolemic the last 48 hours. Your scheduled Lasix 
will not be resumed at discharge.  This will be re-evaluated at 
a follow up appointment, however you should continue with daily 
weights and close management of your fluid restriction and low 
sodium diet.  If any fluid needs to be diuresed, we recommend a 
PRN Lasix dose given your medical history.

Additionally, you developed a pseudoaneurysm post procedure and 
underwent successful guided thrombin injection to embolize the 
pseudoaneurysm.  A repeat ultrasound to re-assess the groin was 
performed ___ and was found to remain stable.

You will be given medicines called Coumadin and Aspirin when you 
leave the hospital. These medicines are important to prevent 
blood clots. You had been tried on Eliquis in the past due to 
your history of atrial fibrillation but had some bleeding and an 
increase in your creatinine and a decline in your kidney 
function at that time as well. While at rehab, the Rehab will 
manage your Coumadin with an INR goal of ___.  At discharge, 
this will be managed by your PCP.  Your PCP should be contacted 
prior to discharge from rehab so that visiting nurse and INR 
draws can be scheduled and coordinated.  Your daily dose at 
discharge from ___ is 1 mg, but your INR should be monitored 
at rehab closely, as it has been high prior to your discharge 
from ___.  With your underlying kidney function and 
your history of difficult to manage INRs we recommend at a 
minimum 1 mg Coumadin daily and to check your INR ___ and once 
stable on a chronic dose, at least twice weekly until the 
facility is certain that you are stable on that regimen.

You should weigh yourself every morning, call your doctor if 
your weight goes up more than 3 lbs in ___ hours. Continue a 
low sodium 2 gram carb consistent diet with Glucerna shakes two 
to three times daily. You should maintain a 1.5 liter fluid 
restriction daily.

Your insulin home dose of Levemir was held (you indicated you 
were on a sliding scale for this at home) along with a sliding 
scale insulin at home and you were maintained on a sliding scale 
insulin while at ___. At discharge, you will be discharged on 
your Levemir scale, and the sliding scale insulin while at 
___.  You should follow up with your PCP as previously 
mentioned post discharge from rehab and review ongoing 
management of your blood glucose.

is seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is 
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting 
of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be 
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There 
is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion. There is a 
prominent left pleural effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe 
global hypokinesis. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 
Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Well-seated TAVR with mild 
aortic regurgitation. Severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
global left ventricular systlic function is now reduced and the 
severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation 
have increased. .The right ventricular cavity is also now 
dilated. 
CXR (___):  Small left pleural effusion, minimally 
decreased.  Left basilar opacification,
mildly improved.  Improved right pleural effusion.  Mildly 
improved pulmonary
vascularity, basilar opacity.  Stable postoperative changes.  
Right PICC line.

Dear Mr. ___,

You were seen in our hospital because you were feeling short of 
breath and weak.  You told us that you had missed several doses 
of your water pill (torsemide) while at a rehab facility after 
your recent valve replacement.  It looked like you had 
accumulated some extra water, so we helped to remove it with 
additional doses of water pill both by mouth and through the IV. 
 By the time we discharged you, you appeared to be at a new dry 
weight of 52.8kg.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of aphasia resulting from 
an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition in which a blood vessel 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a 
clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
Atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis/hyperlipidemia, diabetes
We are changing your medications as follows:
No changes
Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- sudden weakness of one side of the body
- sudden drooping of one side of the face
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
- sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech)
- sudden blurring or doubling of vision
- sudden onset of vertigo (sensation of your environment 
spinning around you)
- sudden clumsiness of the arm and leg on one side or sudden 
tendency to fall to one side (left or right)
- sudden severe headache accompanied by the inability to stay 
awake
It was a pleasure providing you with care during this 
hospitalization.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo female with history of ALS, ventilator 
dependence with trach and PEG in place, history of seizure 
disorder who presents with cough, SOB, and concern for PNA.  

#Ventilator associate pneumonia: On the day of admission, 
patient was undergoing trach exchange but had became briefly 
apneic (question of whether vent was attached at the time); she 
was bagged and brought to ___ where she was responsive 
to painful stimuli only. Patient was placed back on vent; CXR 
was performed which showed diffuse PNA. She received CTX and 
azithromycin and transferred to ___ ICU. At ___, she was 
changed to vanc/zosyn due to concern for VAP. However, hospital 
course was complicated by AIN (see below). This was therefore 
changed to vanc/cefepime as the antibiotics regimen. Sputum 
cultures were positive for 2 different strains of pseudomonas 
with differing sensitivities. She is planned for a total of 15 
days of antibiotics from ___ she had PICC line placed for 
ongoing IV antibiotics. Tracheostomy tube was changed on ___ 
from Portex 7 to Portex soft-seal cuff (15mm connector), inner 
diameter 7.0, outer diameter 10.5.

#AIN: patient's creatinine rose to 1.0 from baseline 0.3, with 
peripheral eosinophilia and urine eosinophils. FeNa >2 
suggestive of intrarenal ___ concerning for AIN with zosyn as 
suspected culprit. Patient's zosyn was subsequently changed to 
cefepime for treatment of VAP and peripheral eosinophilia 
subsequently resolved. Discharge creatinine was 0.9 and should 
be followed up after discharge as described below in the 
transitional issues.

#E. coli UTI: Urine cultures on admission were notable for 
E.coli UTI which was sensitive to cefepime and will be 
adequately treated along with antibiotic course as above for 
VAP.

#NSTEMI: Troponins were increasing to 0.14 at peak with EKG 
showing STE in precordial leads, II, III. Patient was seen by 
cardiology and received aspirin 325 mg, high dose statin, and 
metoprolol. Per cardiology recommendation, she was treated with 
48 hours heparin gtt. She will continue on aspirin, metoprolol, 
and atorvastatin 80 mg qHS as described below in transitional 
issues.  

#ALS: patient follows with ___ providers and at ___ for chronic 
vent management. 

#DM: continued home insulin and sliding scale

#Nutrition: patient was seen by nutrition who made tube feed 
recommendation. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Tracheostomy tube was changed on ___ from Portex 7 to 
Portex soft-seal cuff (15mm connector), inner diameter 7.0, 
outer diameter 10.5.
-Patient was initiated on cefepime for VAP and should complete a 
total ___nding ___ given Pseudomonas in sputum 
culture. 
-Patient had NSTEMI this admission requiring 48 hours of heparin 
gtt. She was initiated on aspirin 81, atorvastatin 80 mg qHS, 
and changed to metoprolol from home propranolol for CAD. Please 
continue in the outpatient setting and consider cardiac 
catheterization in the future. 
-Patient had likely AIN in the setting of zosyn use; please 
CONSIDER AVOIDING ZOSYN in the future.  Please follow up 
creatinine to ensure normalization after zosyn discontinuation.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo female with history of ALS, ventilator 
dependence with tracheostomy and PEG, history of seizure 
disorder, nonverbal but interactive at baseline, who presents 
with concern for non-convulsive status epilepticus after being 
found unresponsive.

Ms ___ was recently admitted to the ___ ICU from ___ 
to ___ for ventilator associated pneumonia. For this prior 
admission, she was undergoing trach exchange at her facility but 
had became briefly apneic (question of whether vent was attached 
at the time); she was bagged and brought to ___ where 
she was responsive to painful stimuli only. CXR was performed 
which showed diffuse PNA. She received CTX and azithromycin and 
transferred to ___ ICU. At ___, she was changed to 
vanc/zosyn due to concern for VAP. Hospital course was 
complicated by AIN, with creatinine rising from 0.3 to 1.0, and 
peripheral eosinophilia and FeNa>2, thought to be due to Zosyn. 
Sputum cultures were positive for 2 strains of pseudomonas with 
variable resistance patterns. Her antibiotic regimen was 
therefore changed to vanc/cefepime, planned for 15 days, to end 
___ via right PICC; vanc was discontinued prior to discharge. 
  Tracheostomy tube was changed on ___ from Portex 7 to 
Portex soft-seal cuff (15mm connector), inner diameter 7.0, 
outer diameter 10.5. She was also found to have an E.coli UTI, 
treated with cefepime. Cardiology was consulted for NSTEMI, as 
troponins were increasing to 0.14 at peak with EKG showing STE 
in precordial leads, II, III.
She was treated medically with 48 hours of heparin IV,  aspirin 
325 mg, high dose statin, and metoprolol. She was clear and 
coherent, alert and interactive, and bedbound when she was 
discharged on ___.

On ___, patient was at her facility, found with decreased 
responsiveness, reacting only to loud voice or sternal rub. BP 
was noted to be 146/96, FSBG 238. She was transferred to ___ 
___, where she was intermittently reactive to physical 
stimuli only, occasionally looking around but mostly lying still 
with eyes closed. At ___, there was concern for sepsis with 
BP 80/60; she was afebrile without hypoxemia. Her eyes were 
closed and she would not follow commands or respond to painful 
stimuli. Labs notable for negative troponin, lactate 1.2, WBC 
12.8, K 5.4, Creat 0.6. EKG showed diffuse J-point elevation, PR 
depression in II, V3-V6.

Head CT showed no acute infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or 
mass.
CXR showed mild persistent RLL consolidation with partial 
obscuring of right hemidiaphragm, although improved since CXR 
during last ___ admission.  
Her hypotension was treated with 2L normal saline.
She was evaluated by neurology who recommended transfer to ___ 
for monitoring for subclinical status epilepticus with EEG. 

In the ED, initial vitals:  T 96.8, BP 147/89, HR 98, RR 16, 
100% SPO2
While in the ED her BP dropped to 78/43, and subsequently 
improved with doses of lorazepam. She was continued on full 
ventilator support with CMV, VT 350, RR 20, PEEP 5, FIO2 30% 
(Same settings from rehab).

On exam in the ED she was noted to be following commands (moving 
eyes, nodding), but unable to move extremities. However she had 
several events with rightward eye deviation, minor mouth 
twitching, and unresponsiveness, and was hypotensive to the ___ 
systolic. These episodes were treated with lorazepam, and 
afterwards her BP improved but she was not following commands, 
not answering questions, not blinking to threat, only grimacing 
to sternal rub. 

Labs demonstrated
--WBC 13 (67.4% PMNs, 5.6% eosinophils), Hgb 10.8, Plt 545
--INR 1.2, PTT 33.2
--Na 145, K 4.8, Bicab 29, creat 0.6, BUN 39

She was treated with aspirin 600mg PR, lorazepam 4mg IV total, 
and loaded with keppra 1000mg. Also received dose of vancomycin 
1000mg IV. 

On arrival to the MICU, she continues to be unresponsive, with 
leftward eye deviation. Initially normotensive with BP 140s, 
subsequently decreased to 80-90s.

IMAGING
___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the study ___, there is little 
interval change.  
Tracheostomy tube remains in place, as does the right subclavian 
PICC line.  
Again there is opacification of the right base with obscuration 
of the 
hemidiaphragm.  Although this could represent volume loss in the 
right lower lobe with associated pleural effusion, in the 
appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have 
to be considered.  Probable atelectatic changes at the left 
base. 

___ TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be estimated. There is a small circumferential pericardial 
effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function. Small circumferential 
pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence for 
hemodynamic compromise.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Right PICC line tip 
terminates at the level of superior SVC.  Heart size and 
mediastinum are stable.  Tracheostomy is in unchanged position.  
No interval development of of new consolidations is seen except 
for persistent right basal opacity which most likely represents 
a combination of atelectasis and infection.  There is small 
amount of pleural effusion bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with ALS s/p trach 
and PEG with recent admission for technical trach issues 
complicated by VAP and type II NSTEMI who presented to ___ 
with decreased mental status, found to have episodes of mucous 
plugging.

# Altered mental status: During last admission, had similar 
brief episodes of unresponsiveness that resolved without 
intervention. Now presents with multiple episodes of 
unresponsiveness, and right then leftward eye deviation. 
Associated hypotension improved with lorazepam, and 
documentation also indicates that she became more responsive, 
with eyes open, following simple commands, prior to becoming 
unresponsive again. Per Neurology consult, these episodes are 
concerning for complex partial seizures, vs non-convulsive 
status epilepticus. Ultimately, etiology was unclear, though she 
has two known infections being treated with cefepime, including 
UTI and PNA. CT head unremarkable. EEG was performed which 
showed no epileptiform activity. She was switched to ceftazidime 
for antibiotic coverage out of concern for altered mental 
status/seizures from cefepime. However, given the lack of 
correlate on EEG and the alternate explanation (ie respiratory 
distress due to mucous plugging), it is likely that her episodes 
both prior to and during admission were NOT seizures. She was 
continued on levetiracetam 750mg PO BID. 

# ECG changes and troponin elevation: Patient with history of 
recent NSTEMI, managed medically. On this admission, she had 
fluctuating EKG changes including intermittent PR depressions, 
and ___ ST segment changes, which appear most 
consistent with J-point elevation. Cardiology was consulted, who 
recommended TTE and trending of cardiac markers. She was found 
to have preserved EF with small pericardial effusion and EKGs 
c/w pericarditis. No further treatment was recommended as the 
diffuse ECG changes were transient and not associated with a 
particular coronary distribution. Her troponins trended downward 
and she had no complaints of chest pain. She was continued on 
ASA, high-dose atorvastatin and metoprolol.

# Ventilator-associated pneumonia: Diagnosed during last 
admission with leukocytosis, fever, RLL infiltrate, treated with 
cefepime for planned 15 day course, to end ___. CXR at ___ 
___ shows mild persistent RLL infiltrate. She is having 
minimal tracheal secretions now, mild leukocytosis, and no 
reported fevers or hypoxemia on 30% FIO2. ___ not need to 
complete full 15 day treatment

# Acute hypoxic respiratory distress: Her hospital course was 
notable for acute hypoxemic event due to mucous plugging. On 
___, the patient became acutely hypoxic down into the 40's 
following a change in position. She was taken off the ventilator 
and bad masked given coinciding decreases in tidal volume. 
Emergent bronchoscopy was performed which revealed severe mucus 
plugging worse in the RLL. This plugging was relieved and 
patient's oxygen saturations came back up to high 90's. During 
this episode was observed to have extensor posturing and roving 
eye movements, however neurology evaluated clinical findings 
along with EEG and determined that they were not seizures. 
During the event patient was hypertensive with SBP up to 240's, 
fentanyl and versed bolus for sedation was given, as well as 10 
mg IV labetalol. Pressures continued to be elevated throughout 
the afternoon and metoprolol was doubled from 6.25 Q6 to 12.5 
Q6. To assist with the clearance of her secretions, she was 
placed on the Mechanical Insufflator Exsufflator machine, which 
significantly assisted improved her cough. She should use this 
every eight hours and also as needed.

# Chronic respiratory failure: Mechanically ventilated, does not 
require sedation. She was continued on prior vent settings: CMV, 
TV 350, RR 20, FIO2 30% but with an increase in PEEP from 5 to 
8.

# Diabetes mellitus: continued home lantus and insulin sliding 
scale.

# HTN: was started on metoprolol 12.5mg PO Q6hrs. Would 
recommend continued monitoring of BP and titration of regimen at 
facility.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay 
at ___. You were admitted after 
you were confused and less responsive than normal. The 
Neurologists evaluated you and discovered that you are not 
having any seizures. You can continue the same Keppra as before. 
We also asked the Cardiologists to see you because of your 
history of a recent heart attack and some changes on your EKG. 
They felt that you were not having a new heart issue and did not 
recommend any new treatment. During your hospital stay, you had 
a brief episode of getting some mucous and sputum caught in your 
airway that caused you to lose consciousness. We were able to 
suck the mucous out with a bronchoscopy. From now, we recommend 
that you something called the MIE or Cough Assist to help you 
bring up secretions so as to prevent this from happening again. 
We are discharging you back to your facility where they can 
finish your antibiotic treatment for pneumonia and provide you 
with the Cough Assist as well.

We wish you the best!
- Your ___ Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo female with history of ALS, ventilator 
dependence with tracheostomy and PEG, history of seizure 
disorder, nonverbal but interactive at baseline, who presents as 
a transfer from ___ for hypoxemia.

#Respiratory Failure: patient ventilator dependent from ALS with 
chronic trach. Desatted acutely at nursing facility and improved 
rapidly with suctioning. Etiology likely mucus plugging from 
impaired secretion clearance due to ALS. No infiltrate on 
imaging to suggest PNA, was not treated with antibiotics in ICU. 
MIE (cough assist device) used q8hours effectively here. 
Bronchoscopy did not show any residual plugging. Patient is 
being discharged to a facility that has respiratory therapy on 
site to prevent this type of occurrence from happening again.

#G-tube placement: patient presented with foley tubing in g-tube 
stoma that was being used as g-tube. Patient underwent ___ guided 
placement of appropriate G-J tube that functioned well following 
placement.  

#Troponinemia: Patient with trop of 0.16, less than last trop of 
0.21 on previous admission which was not thought to represent 
ACS, but rather pericarditis given PR elevation and small 
effusion seen on echo. Denied any chest pain and EKG showed ST 
changes consistent with prior. Likely related to LVH.

#Seizure PPX: Patient admitted for episodes of AMS with concern 
for seizure last admission. Although she ultimately was thought 
not to be having seizures, given her risk she was continued on 
Keppra and this was continued on this admission.

#IDDM:
Continued lantus/regular insulin

#Agitation/?shizoaffective disorder: 
Continued home Seroquel and setraline

Transitional Issues:
Please use MIE as frequently as possible (at least q6h) to 
prevent mucus plugging
Please note ventilator settings noted in discharge physical exam
Please note bronchoscopy showed no significant mucous plugging; 
see detailed culture results from ___ bronchoscopy in results 
section.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ woman with a 2 day history of right 
lower quadrant pain.  Upon admisssion, her white blood cell 
count was 22.  She underwent a CT scan which  showed a 
phlegmonous mass in the right lower quadrant with associated 
induration of her cecum, terminal ileum, and adjacent loop of 
small bowel and a fecalith in the appendix.  There was no 
obvious abscess cavity.  She was initially treated with IV 
antibiotics but failed to respond.  In the emergency room the 
patient was reportedly hypotensive and required additional 
intravenous fluids.  She was admitted to the intensive care unit 
for monitoring.  

On HD #2, the patient was taken to the operating room where she 
was found to have a perforated appendix.  She underwent an 
extended open appendectomy.  The cecum was significantly 
indurated at the base of the appendix.  There was a normal area 
of cecum between the appendix and the terminal ileum and a 
cecectomy was  performed.  The operative course was stable with 
minimal blood loss.  The patient was extubated after the 
procedure and monitored in the recover room.

The patient was transferred to the surgical floor on POD #2 in 
stable condition. She resumed a clear liquid diet and progresed 
to a regular diet.  Her incisional pain was controlled with oral 
analgesia and she was voiding without difficulty. Appointments 
for follow-up were made with the acute care service and with her 
primary care provider.  The patient was discharged home with her 
daughter. She was instructed in her home antibiotic course at 
discharge

injuries and you are preparing for discharge home with the 
following instructions:

  ACTIVITY:
 
Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs. 
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 6 weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.)
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first.
You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you 
otherwise.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
 
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want to 
nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. You 
might feel somewhat depressed.
You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Your incision may be slightly red aroudn the stitches or 
staples. This is normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. (These are the thin 
paper strips that might be on your incision.) But if they fall 
off before that that's okay).
It is normal to feel a firm ridge along the incision. This will 
go away.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining 
your dressing r clothes. If the staining is severe, please call 
your surgeon.
You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
Ove the next ___ months, your incision will fade and become 
less prominent.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of medicine such as 
Percocet or codeine. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving 
the bowels, call your surgeon.
After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get diarrhea, 
don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of fluitds and 
see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is severe and 
you feel ill, please call your surgeon.
 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is 
getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
You will receive a prescription from your surgeon for pain 
medicine to take by mouth. It is important to take this medicine 
as directied. Do not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do 
not take more medicine at one time than prescribed.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
IF you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough 
or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the folloiwng, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
In some cases you will have a prescription for antibiotics or 
other medication.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
 
DANGER SIGNS:
Please call your surgeon if you develop:
- worsening abdominal pain
- sharp or severe pain that lasts several hours
- temperature of 101 degrees or higher
- severe diarrhea
- vomiting
- redness around the incision that is spreading
- increased swelling around the incision
- excessive bruising around the incision
- cloudy fluid coming from the wound
- bright red blood or foul smelling discharge coming from the 
wound
- an increase in drainage from the wound

History of Present Illness:
___ right-handed ___ man with a past medical history 
of left
frontal stroke in ___ leading to residual aphasia, 
hemiparesis,incontinence and cognitive decline, who now presents 
after afall. OSH imaging was concerning for a cerebellar 
hemorrhage, so both neurosurgery and neurology were consulted to 
assist in evaluation of this.

complex activities like playing cards, also worsening 
incontinence. 

Four days ago, pt had an unwitnessed fall in bathroom, heard by 
caretaker. He had a left temporo-parietal laceration from 
this,which initially bled profusely. The caretaker called the 
pt's previous PCP in ___, who recommended holding aspirin. The 
next day, left leg swelling was noted. Pt has been in bed or 
sitting up in a chair for the entirety of the last 4 days, 
unable to
ambulate. His appetite and oral intake have been poor. He 
appears significantly more lethargic than usual to the ___ (who 
just
returned from a trip to ___ and ___ the pt to the ED). His
aspirin has been held. He has been getting an ___ combination

      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT 
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION. 

STUDIES:
=========================================
EKG (___)
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Intraventricular conduction 
delay. 
Consider anteroseptal myocardial infarction. ST-T wave 
abnormalities. No 
previous tracing available for comparison.  

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___)
An 8 mm hyperdensity is seen in the cerebellum on the left, 
likely 
representing an intraparenchymal hemorrhage or possibly a 
hyperdense lesion 
such as a vascular malformation which is considered less likely. 
Mild 
surrounding hypodensity is seen suggesting edema without 
significant mass 
effect.  There is no evidence of mass effect, or infarction.  
Prominent 
ventricles and sulci suggest age related involutional changes or 
atrophy.  
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with 
chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease.  The basal cisterns appear patent and 
there is 
preservation of gray-white matter differentiation.  
  
No fracture is identified.  Visualized paranasal sinuses, 
mastoid air cells, 
and middle ear cavities are clear.  The globes are intact.   
  
IMPRESSION:  Focus of hyperdensity in the cerebellum on the 
left, likely 
representing an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, less likely a 
hyperdense lesion 
such as a vascular malformation.  Recommend followup imaging to 
ensure 
expected evolution. 

CT C-SPINE (___)
1. Degenerative changes without cervical spine fracture or 
subluxation.    
2. Hyperdensity within the cerebellum is better characterized on 
dedicated head CT.   

CXR (___)
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.   

FEMUR (___)
Displaced right intertrochanteric femoral neck fracture.  No 
dislocation.

ECHO (___)
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 
45-50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal-distal anterior 
septum. The LV apex was not well seen (possibly hypokinetic). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral regurgitation.There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new. Pulmonary 
pressures are higher. Other findings are similar.  

LOWER EXTREMITY FLUORO (___)
Images from the operating suite show placement of fixation 
device 
about the fracture of the proximal right femur.  Further 
information can be 
gathered from the operative report. 
  
KNEE XRAY (___)
There is moderate right knee joint effusion.  There are no signs 

for acute fractures or dislocations.  The knee joint spaces are 
relatively 
preserved.  On the AP view, there is some periosteal thickening 
along the 
lateral aspect of the distal femoral metaphysis.  This may be 
due to prior old 
trauma.  Alternatively, the patient has lung pathology, this may 
represent 
hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___)
1.  Stable right cerebellar hemispheric hyperdense focus, with 
surrounding ring of vasogenic edema.     
These findings are concerning for underlying malignancy, 
although they may also be compatible with parenchymal contusion 
or primary (hypertensive) hemorrhage.  Enhanced MRI could be 
considered for further characterization of the lesion.     
2.  No evidence of new hemorrhage or large territorial 
infarction.   
3.  Age related atrophic changes and evidence of chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH significant for prior left thalamic ischemic CVA 
in ___ with residual aphasia presented s/p fall 4 days prior to 
admission. OSH imaging concerning for a cerebellar hemorrhage. 
Initial hospital course as below.

On the night of ___  he was found to have vomited copious 
coffee ground emesis, his O2 sat was 75% on RA, and he was in 
acute respiratory distress.  Small amounts of coffee grounds 
were suctioned from his airway, and his SpO2 improved to low ___ 
on a non-rebreather mask but could not be weaned.  Lactate found 
to be 4.3, VBG 7.27/49/70 and ABG 7.37/41/75.  CXR showed a new 
infiltrate in RLL consistent with likely aspiration event as 
well as dilated loops of bowel. Gastroccult was positive so a 
PPI bolus + drip was started.  Family was called and after 
discussion with his health care providers regarding his clinical 
circumstances, the decision was made to change his code status 
to DNR/DNI and he was transferred to the MICU for further care. 

On arrival to the MICU, a goals of care discussion was held with 
the family and the decision was made to make the patient comfort 
measures only. The family was in accordance with this plan and 
all of their questions regarding his clinical circumstances were 
answered. He was placed on a morphine drip for comfort. Time of 
death was 8:05am on ___. Organ bank was notifed, but 
declined donation. The family declined autopsy, and while 
saddened by his death, they endorsed appreciation of the medical 
care he had received while at ___. 

========================================
# Cerebellar hemorrhage:
The patient was evaluated by neurology and neurosurgery, who 
felt the cerebellar hemorrhage was likely due to spontaneous 
bleed rather than a contusion. The hemorrhage also appears to be 
non-acute. The patient did not have any indications for 
neurosurgical intervention as imaging did not reveal mass effect 
or midline shift. Furthermore, the patient's neurologic 
examination remained stable. Aspirin was discontinued in setting 
of spontaneous bleed. 

# S/p right trochanteric fracture:
Patient s/p trochanteric fixation on ___ without 
complications. The patient's pain was initially managed with 
morphine, however this was later discontinued as he developed 
urinary retention. The patient's pain was controlled with 
standing tylenol. 

# Acute kidney injury:
Cr on admission 2.9, baseline 1.1-1.3. Etiology likely pre-renal 
as patient had poor PO intake prior to admission. NSAIDs may 
have contributed as well. 

# Hypernatremia:
Likely secondary to hypovolemia as patient had poor PO intake. 
Hypernatemia corrected with IVF.

# UTI:
Urinalysis with pyuria and bacteriuria. The patient was started 
on ciprofloxacin, but this was discontinued on day 3 when 
cultures returned negative.

# Acute urinary retention:
Patient has a history of urinary incontinence. Etiology of acute 
urinary retention thought to be secondary to post-operative 
urinary retention due to opioid use. A foley was placed and 
opioids discontinued. The patient failed a voiding trial x 3. 

# Normocytic anemia:
Patient presented with normocytic anemia. He required 2 units of 
RBCs during this admission. Iron studies were done after the 
patient received the transfusions. The patient was started on 
ferrous sulfate. 

- Health care proxy ___. Phone

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo right handed man who presents for
evauation of decreased mentation.  The history was obtained from
the patient's family as the patient is currently unable. 

Mr. ___ is typically alert and independent.  Three days ago he
began to become incontinent at night, which was new for him.  He
was given depends to wear at night but then his incontinence was
also occuring during the day.  Yesterday during the day, he 
began
to appear confused.  Per his son, he was playing cards and had a
hard time dealing the cards and understanding the game (which he
previously knew well).  Yesterday evening he was called to 
dinner
but he was unable to get up from his chair.  With assistance, he
was able to walk but he appeared to have difficulty moving his
legs and he would have fallen if he was not held up.  He sat 
down
at the table to eat, but he was silent during the meal.  His
daughter-in-law noted that he appeared to have problems using 
his
utensils- as if he couldn't figure out how much food to put on
them.  He had no difficultly bringing them to his mouth.  

This AM, the patient seemed to have difficulty speaking, not
answering most questions but occasionally nodding yes or no or
giving one word answers.  At times he would have a blank stare
and be slow to respond.   He was taken to ___
where vitals were BP 124/58, RR 16, Temp 98.3.  The patient
underwent CT which raised concern for a frontal hemorrhage.  He
was also felt to have a UTI and he was treated with ceftriaxone. 

Because of his possible hemorrhage, he was transferred to ___
for further eval.

The patient is unable to offer a ROS.  Family says no recent
fevers, chills, stool has been normal.  He has had no complaints
of headache or any other discomfort.  They note he has lost alot
of weight this year.

*************
___ EEG: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG due to 
mild 
generalized slowing of background with superimposed left 
hemispheric 
focal slowing with rare blunted sharp waves in this region. 
These 
findings are indicative of a mild generalized encephalopathy 
with focal 
left hemispheric subcortical dysfunction. The blunted sharp 
waves did 
not meet the criteria for epileptiform discharges. No 
electrographic 
seizures were present in this record. 
************

___- CT/CT angiogram of Head and Neck:  
1. Ectasia but no steno-occlusive disease or aneurysm larger 
than 2mm 
invoving the intracranial arteries. 
  
2. Approximately 50% stenosis in the proximal to mid-cervical 
left internal 
carotid artery with ulcerative plaque. Further evaluation with 
dedicated 
sonography of the cervical vessels is recommended.  
  
3. Right hilar lymphadenopathy measuring up to 1.8 cm, 
incompletely 
visualized on this study. Given right apical scarring, this may 
be due to 
granulomatous disease. However, other etiologies, including 
neoplasm, are not 
excluded. 
*************

___- Echocardiogram: 
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers (though views were technically 
suboptimal). Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The 
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular 
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion.  
*************

___- Carotid Artery Ultrasound:
1. Less than 40% stenosis in the bilateral internal carotid 
arteries. 
2. Prominent homogeneous plaque at the proximal left internal 
carotid artery. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ was admitted for further workup. His exam was notable 
for being able to obey simple non-verbal commands, but not ones 
that required verbal responses with mild right sided weakness. 
.
The initial CT showed diffuse cerebral atrophy, with evidence of 
an old small stroke in the Left thalamus, but no acute bleed. He 
was unable to tolerate lying on his back for the initial MRI, 
and when it was repeated the results were severely limited 
because of the significant dental artifact. He became more alert 
over 3 days, but on HD#3 developed increased right sided 
weakness, concerning for a progression of his symptoms and 
evolving intracranial process. A CT/CT angiogram was done and 
did not show any parenchymal changes, but did show a possibly 
ulcerated plaque in left carotid artery. Follow up ultrasound 
did not reveal this ulceration, however he clinically appeared 
to have suffered a stroke. An MRI was attempted but of limited 
use given the patient's extensive dental fillings that caused 
artifact. An LP was also obtained to rule out an infectious 
eitiology to explain his symptoms, but this was negative. In 
further discussion with the family, it was determined that Mr. 
___ might also have had some slowly progressing loss of verbal 
ability, though this was difficult to assess as he primarily 
lived in ___ and spoke with the family only intermittently. 
.
He was maintained on higher dose of aspirin (325 mg), and 
started on pravastatin for an LDL of 125. ___ therapies 
were consulted, and they recommended an ___ rehab facility 
to assist with recovery. Given that the patient is originally 
from ___, the traveller's insurance that he obtained would not 
cover the expense of an ___ rehabilitation stay. 
.
The family was deciding between placing him in a ___ 
rehab facility vs. having him taken care of at home with 
visiting ___/ and speech therapy. Ulitmately, they decided to 
bring him home with services to be provided in house. A home 
safety evaluation was ordered for after discharge. 
.
FEN/GI: Initially some concern for aspiration, but was cleared 
by video swallow study for regular vegetarian diet.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___, 
You were admitted to ___ following a few days where you had 
trouble with incontinence, confusion, difficulty walking, and 
speech arrest. A head CT was done on admission and showed 
changes related to aging and an old stroke in the region of the 
brain called the thalamus (on left), but no acute bleed or 
masses. 
.
An EEG was done initially because there was a thought you might 
be having seizures, but there was just some ""spike"" activity 
without seizure recorded. A trial of Keppra was done but was 
stopped because it did not help your clinical picture.
. 
On your third hospital day, you developed what appeared to be 
worsening weakness on your right side, and so a CT/ with 
angiogram was done to evaluate the blood vessels in the brain. 
There were no changes on the CT, but the angiogram showed a 
possible plaque in the internal carotid artery that could have 
sent small clots up into the smaller vessels in the brain. An 
ultrasound of the carotid artery was done and was limited by 
motion, but did not show evidence of a plaque that could throw 
clots. 
.
A lumbar puncture was done to rule out any infections, and was 
within normal limits. Over the next few days, you clinically 
appreared to have suffered a stroke, though the MRI attempt was 
unsuccessful due to your extensive dental fillings. You were 
started on high dose aspirin, simvastatin for an elevated LDL, 
and recieved intensive physical/occupational/and speech therapy 
during the admission. Your speech improved a little bit and you 
were able to follow simple commands, but you still required much 
support with walking, which prevented your discharge for a few 
days. 
.
At the time of discharge, you were maintained on HALF the dose 
of your blood pressure medication (2.5 mg amplodipine daily), 
and this should be continued after discharge. You will have 
follow up with a new primary care doctor, ___ also 
with Dr. ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ was admitted to the hospital after takedown of his end 
ileostomy with ileocolic anastomosis on ___. His course was 
complicated by a upper GIB. An EGD was done that revealed severe 
esophagitis with a 1cm ulcer at the pylorus as well as small 
ulcers in the proximal duodenum without any areas of active 
bleeding.  The patient was monitored in the intensive care unit 
where he received 2 units of blood. Shortly after this, the 
patient was reported to have a wound separation, the staples 
were removed and the wound was debrided.  A VAC dressing was 
placed on ___ to promote wound healing.  The patient stabilized 
and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on ___. 

Mr. ___ was re-admitted to the hospital on ___ from the 
___ facility after he was noted to have green, feculent 
drainage from the middle of his abdominal wound.  Prior to this, 
he was reported to be doing well and was preparing for discharge 
home.  Upon admission to the hospital, he was made NPO, given 
intravenous fluids, and underwent imaging. He was reported to 
have extensive intra-abdominal abscesses as well as an 
enteroatmospheric fistula through his open midline incisional 
wound.  He was taken to ___  where he underwent placement of 2 
percutaneous drainage catheters into the right pelvic fluid 
collections under CT guidance. Cultures from the wound were 
reported to be growing E.coli and proteus.  The patient was 
started on a course a 2 week course of meropenum.  At the time 
of his admission, he was  having diarrhea and a stool specimen 
was sent for c.diff which returned positive.  The patient was 
started on a course of flagyl. 

Throughout his hospital course the patient's vital signs were 
closely monitored and his electrolytes repleted.  To maintain 
his nutritional status, he resumed TPN.  Because of his NPO 
status, his anticoagulation was changed from coumadin to 
lovenox.  On HD #1, the patient was reported to have premature 
ventricular beats and runs of ventricular ectopy.  His 
hemodynamic status remained stable.  His electroyltes were 
repleted.  Despite this, he ectopy continued and a cardiology 
consult was called.  The patient was started on intravenous 
metoprolol and enalapril.  Over the next ___ hours, his ectopy 
resolved. Throughout his hospitalization, the patient has 
experienced bouts of confusion, but re-orients easily to time 
and place.   

In preparation for discharge, the patient was evaluated by 
physical therapy and recommendations were made for discharge to 
a rehabilitation center where the patient could be provided with 
cardiac monitoring, TPN support, and wound care management.  The 
patient was discharged on HD # 6 in stable condition. 
An appointment for follow-up was made with the acute care 
service and the Cardiology service.

was performed 
on the bilateral lower extremity veins. 
  
COMPARISON:  Bilateral lower extremity vein US ___ 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation of the 
bilateral common 
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. Normal color 
flow and 
compressibility are demonstrated in the posterior tibial and 
peroneal veins. 
  
There is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral 
veins bilaterally. 
  
No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst. 
  
IMPRESSION:

EXAMINATION:  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
  
INDICATION:  ___ with history of CHF, CAD, AFib on Coumadin, R 
colectomy 
(___) an s/p end ileostomy take down (___) c/b EC fistula, 
multiple pelvic 
fluid collection s/p ___ drainage now presents with respiratory 
distress  and 
altered mental status. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial MDCT images were obtained through 
the brain 
without the administration of IV contrast.  Reformatted coronal, 
sagittal and 
thin section bone algorithm-reconstructed images were then 
generated. 
  
DOSE:  CTDIvol: ___ MGy 
DLP: 915 mGy-cm 
  
COMPARISON:  Noncontrast head CT from ___. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, 
mass effect, or 
large territorial infarction. 
  
Age-related cerebral atrophy is again seen. There is 
extensivesubcortical, 
deep, and periventricular white matter hypodensities, which are 
most likely 
sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  Chronic 
lacunar infarcts 
are seen in bilateral basal ganglia. 
  
The basal cisterns appear patent and there is preservation of 
gray-white 
matter differentiation. 
  
The visualized bony structures are grossly unremarkable. 
  
A mucous retention cyst is seen in the right maxillary sinus. 
The other 
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities 
are clear.  The 
globes are unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
No acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or large territorial 
infarction.  If 
continued clinical concern, MRI is recommended for further 
evaluation of acute 
infarct. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 


INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation on coumadin status post right 
colectomy in 
___ and recent end ileostomy takedown complicated by an 
enterocutaneous 
fistula and multiple pelvic fluid collections. Patient now 
presents 
respiratory distress. Evaluate for leak and or strictures. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen 
and pelvis 
without the administration of intravenous contrast. Coronal and 
sagittal 
reformations were provided and reviewed. Gastrografin as oral 
contrast was 
administered.  Images through the pelvis were repeated 2 
additional times to 
allow contrast to pass through the anastomosis. 
  
DOSE:  DLP: 2310.89 mGy-cm 
  
COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___bdomen and 
pelvis ___. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
Small bilateral pleural effusions are smaller from 4 days prior. 
 There is 
persistent overlying atelectasis. The included portion the heart 
is mildly 
enlarged and shows no pericardial effusion. Focal coronary 
artery 
calcifications and aortic valve calcifications are mild. 
  
Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs is limited by the lack 
of intravenous 
contrast. Within this limitation, the liver, spleen, pancreas 
and adrenal 
glands are unremarkable.  The gallbladder surgically absent. The 
kidneys show 
no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.  A hypodensity in the 
posterior left 
kidney is incompletely evaluated but appears unchanged from ___ and 
is presumably a simple cyst.  The aorta is normal caliber. 
  
An NG tube terminates in the fundus of the stomach. With repeat 
imaging, oral 
contrast progresses distal to the ileocolonic anastomosis.  
There is no 
extraluminal contrast to indicate a leak.  There may be a small 
enteroenteric 
fistula (04:59).  A pigtail catheter is seen within an anterior 
abdominal 
fluid collection which now measures 5.3 x 3.7 x 1.8 cm, 
unchanged from ___.  The catheter appears separate from the bulk of 
the remaining 
collection.  There has been near resolution of the pelvic fluid 
collection 
with the pigtail drain remaining in situ.  Smaller abdominal 
fluid collections 
persist but are unchanged (i.e. 2:60). There is no evidence of 
an EC fistula.  
There is a large ventral hernia with loops of nonobstructed 
bowel. A small 
amount of abdominal free fluid is present but unchanged in 
volume. 
  
The bladder is collapsed. This Foley balloon appears to be 
inflated within the 
prostate and should be repositioned. There is a small, air 
filled bladder 
diverticulum (2:71). The rectum is unremarkable. There is no 
free pelvic 
fluid. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy. 
  
There are no lytic or blastic osseous lesions in the abdomen or 
pelvis.  
Severe to moderate degenerative changes of the lower lumbar 
spine are again 
noted.  The bones are demineralized. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
1. Unchanged size of the anterior abdominal fluid collection 
from ___ with a pigtail catheter slightly removed from the bulk of 
the remaining 
fluid. 
2.  Near resolution of the pelvic fluid collection, this 
catheter can likely 
be removed. 
3. No evidence of leak or EC fistula. 
4. Decrease in size of bilateral pleural effusions from 4 days 
prior, now 
small. 
5. Foley catheter balloon appears to be inflated within the 
prostate and 
should be repositioned. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the clinic on ___ and was noted to 
be in respiratory distress. and admitted to the ED for further 
management, then transferred to the ward for observation. 
Neuro: The patient throughout his course remained confused. A 
___ obtained ___ showed evidence of diffuse atrophy, diffuse 
white matter small vessel disease and bilateral chronic lacunar 
infarcts. His exam was notable for disorientation and 
inattention. Also noted is L>R weakness and a slight flattening 
of the left nasal labial fold. Per neurology, given the lacunar 
infarcts seen on ___ and prior MRI, it is likely that the 
deficits found are related to a prior stroke(s) and may be more 
apparent with recrudencence in the setting of his acute illness. 
The strokes would not be expected to cause any change in mental 
status. However the patient's diffuse white matter disease and 
atrophy indicate a poor substrate and a predisposition to 
delirium in the setting of infection and/or other toxic 
metabolic insults, which appears to be the most likely cause of 
his current state. Further recommendations are no acute 
indication for further imaging of the brain as his current 
deficits can be correlated with prior strokes seen on CT. In 
addition, avoiding sedating, mind altering medications and 
disruptions of sleep wake cycle
CV: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation currently 
managed with lovenox ginve his previous upper GI bleeding on 
POD3 after his colostom take down. During his current hospital 
course he presented with asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular 
tachycardia. He was managed with beta blockade (metoprolol 5mg 
IVq6h and switched to metoprolol 12.5 mg q8h) after the 
cardiology service was consulted. Per cardiology, the meotprolol 
dose needs to be tritated up to achieve a HR goal of 60-80. 
Then, the metoprolol can be converted to long acting. Patient 
will be seen by Dr. ___ on ___ at ___.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint. He was started on diuresis with lasix 40 mg IV daily 
and wean off to 20 mg IV daily. Currently, he has been switched 
to torsemide 10 mg PO daily.  
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO and Promote w/ 
Fiber @ 80 mL/hr
___ kcals, 119g protein). He was evaluated by speech therapy 
at the bed side and reassessed with a video swallow on  ___ which demonstrated no perforations. He was initiated on a 
puree thin liquid diet, which was well tolerated. In addition, 
on ___ he started complaining of liquid stools. A new 
C. diff test was sent off which was negative. Banana flakes were 
added as a nutrition supplementation following the nutritionist 
recommendations. Please monitor daily lytes, to mantain a K>4.0 
and Mg>2.0.
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection. The patient presented with an acute urinary tract 
infection which is being treated with Linezolid (___). 
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none. He underwnt a bilateral 
doppler to rule out a clot, which there were none. In addition, 
he was kept on lovenox 80mg BID during the hospital course and 
plan is to bridge back to his home dose of coumadin. INR must be 
watch daily and lovenox needs to be discontinued once INR is 
therapuetic.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable. The patient received discharge 
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding 
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

kyphosis. 

MRI C&T SPINE: 
1. Acute anterior and posterior vertebral body fracture of the 
T3 with 4 mm retropulsion of the posterior vertebral body, 
moderately narrowing the vertebral canal at the level. Possible 
posterior ligamentous complex disruption at T3-4. No subluxation

1. 2.5 X 1.5 cm aneurysm possibly arising from the left 
posterior 
communicating artery origin of the left internal carotid artery 
with at the carotid canal. Angiogram or CTA with 3D 
reconstruction is recommended for further evaluation of the 
aneurysm. 

CTA Head/Neck:
1. 2.4 x 1.5 cm left internal carotid aneurysm arising at the 
bifercation of the posterior communicating artery. The neck of 
the artery measuring up to 5 mm. 
2. Air locule within the head likely from venous injection. 
3. Posterior head laceration s/p skin stapling. 
4. Patent circle of ___ and its major tributaries. 
Final read pending 3D reconstructions.

OSH studies:
Pan CT showing new T3 compression fx, 3 non
displaced L rib fx, old T5 fx, CT head also showing likely

thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an ___ year-old female with a history of breast 
cancer status-post lumpectomy, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia 
who presented to ___ for syncope and fall with 
multiple vertebral fractures. She was transferred to ___, 
where she was found to have a urinary tract infection as well as 
an internal carotid artery aneurism. Her UTI was treated with 
Ciprofloxacin. She was briefly placed in a soft collar for 
musculoskeletal injuries, and neurosurgery recommended 
outpatient follow-up for her aneurism. She was discharged in 
stable condition on an increased dose of amlodipine to manage 
hypertension in the setting of internal carotid aneurysm.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# Syncope:
The patient experienced syncope of unclear etiology. She had an 
EKG and troponin that were normal, no findings on telemetry, 
non-orthostatic vitals, a normal neurologic examination, and had 
no witnessed seizure activity during hospitalization. The 
patient had no further episodes of syncope during 
hospitalization. She also had an echocardiogram which was 
normal. Therefor syncope was likely in the setting of 
orthostasis vs vasovagal. 

# Left internal carotid aneurysm:
This aneurism was discovered on Head CT and followed up with 
CTA. The patient had no focal neurologic deficits. Neurosurgery 
was consulted and recommended outpatient follow-up. She should 
follow up with neurosurgery.  It was thought unlikely that this 
was a cause of her syncope.

# Fall resulting in fractures of T2, T3, T5, and left ribs ___:
The patient was seen and evaluated by acute care surgery as well 
as orthopedic spine service. She was briefly placed in a soft 
collar, which was subsequently removed. She should follow up in 
the orthopedic spine clinic.

# Urinary Tract Infection:
The patient was found to have leukocytosis and urinalysis 
suggestive of urinary tract infection in the absence of 
symptoms. She was started on Ciprofloxacin, which she should 
continue until ___.

# Hypokalemia:
RESOLVED. This was likely in the setting of decreased PO intake 
surrounding the patient's fall.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Hypertension:
The patient had pressures consistently above 140 systolic in the 
setting of internal carotid artery aneurism. She was discharged 
on an increased dose of amlodipine, now 10mg daily (from 5mg 
previously). She was continued on enalapril, atenolol, and 
aspirin.

# Insomnia: Continued home zolpidem.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Syncope: Please follow up with orthostatic vitals monitoring 
as outpatient. 
# ICA Aneurysm: Patient to follow up with neurosurgery as 
outpatient next week to determine plan for intervention. 
# Orthopedic Spine Clinic: Patient to follow up with orthopedic 
spine clinic for newly diagnosed vertebral and rib fractures. 
Patient to also continue physical therapy as outpatient.
# UTI: Patient to complete therapy with ciprofloxacin until 
___. 
# Hypokalemia: Please repeat CBC, and electrolytes upon 
follow-up. 
# Hypertension: Amlodopine increased to 10 mg daily to have SBP 
< 140 given new diagnosis of internal carotid artery aneurism. 
Please continue to monitor cardiopulmonary assessment, and 
adjust regimen as needed. 

CODE: Full, with limited trial of life-sustaining treatment. 
Recommend continued discussion about code status with family.

Pertinent Results:
___ - Coiling of Cerebral Aneurysm:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Successful primary coiling of a giant left PCOM aneurysm 
compatible with ___ grade 2 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S): 
1. Continue on aspirin and follow-up as per usual protocol. 

___ - CTA Head and Neck: 
RECOMMENDATION(S): 
1. Consider further evaluation of probable infarct with MR of 
the head. 
2. Consider further evaluation of the hemopericardium and 
mediastinal hematoma with chest CTA. 
3. Though intracranial hemorrhage is not definitively excluded, 
this can be investigated with follow-up noncontrast head CT. 

___ - ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, 
and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 61 %). 
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal 
septum. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). 
Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular 
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within 
normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

___ -  Chest X-Ray:
Compared to chest radiographs ___ 
Cardiac silhouette is substantially larger due to progressive 
cardiomegaly and likely pericardial effusion.  Mild mediastinal 
widening is due to distension of mediastinal veins, reflecting 
increase in right heart filling pressure.  Tamponade to be 
excluded clinically.  Combination of moderate bilateral pleural 
effusion and substantial bibasilar atelectasis, perhaps 
bilateral lower lobe collapse, is new.  There is no pulmonary 
edema. 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Echocardiography to evaluate pericardium and 
heart. 

___ -  CTA Chest:
1.  Mediastinal hematoma has mildly decreased since ___.  
Hemorrhagic pleural effusions have mildly increased.  There is 
small 
hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.  Images of the ascending aorta 
are 
moderately compromised by motion.  No definite evidence for 
dissection or 
pulmonary embolism.  If there is high index of suspicion for 
aortic injury, catheter angiogram would be helpful. 
2.  Acute left rib fractures again noted.  Worsened T3 
compression fracture. 

___ - CT Head without Contrast:
1. Left PCOM aneurysm coil mass streak artifact and motion 
moderately limits examination. 
2. Within limits of study, no evidence of intracranial 
hemorrhage. 
3. Grossly stable punctate bihemispheric sulcal and 
intraventricular fat.  
Question history of ruptured dermoid or epidermoid tumor versus 
multiple small lipomas. 
4. Please note MRI of the brain is more sensitive for the 
detection of acute infarct. 

___ - Chest X-Ray:
Heart size is enlarged.  Mediastinum is overall unchanged 
although mildly 
enlarged most likely due to a adjacent area of atelectasis.  
Large bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no 
pneumothorax. 

___ - CTA Torso:
1. Superior mediastinal hematoma, without evidence for active 
extravasation, 
not significantly changed. 
2. High-density, moderate size pleural effusions, not 
significantly changed, 
likely representing hemothorax. 
3. Bilateral rib fractures again noted. 
4. Compression deformities of T3 and T5. 
5. No retroperitoneal hematoma. 
6. Large cystic lesion, likely arising from the left ovary, 
predominately 
simple, with peripheral calcification. 
7. Fluid in the endometrial canal, abnormal, given the patient's 
age. 
8. Diverticulosis. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S): Nonurgent pelvic ultrasound is recommended 
for further 
evaluation of the cystic left adnexal lesion, and fluid in the 
endometrial 
canal. 

___ Chest X-Ray:
Cardiomegaly is substantial associated with bilateral pleural 
effusions which a large but appear to be slightly decreased 
since the prior study.  There is mild vascular congestion.  
There is no pneumothorax. 

___ CT Head without Contrast:
1. No notable interval change. Patient is post left PCOM 
aneurysm coiling. 
2. Unchanged bihemispheric sulcal intraventricular fat my 
reflect previously ruptured dermoid or multiple small lipomas. 

___ CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:  
1. No acute pulmonary embolus or aortic abnormality. 
2. Persistent moderate bilateral right greater than left 
hemorrhagic pleural effusions was slight interval decrease in 
size on the right and mild bilateral relaxation atelectasis. 
3. Stranding and high density within the anterior mediastinum 
extending into the supraclavicular space is similar to the prior 
exam on ___ but markedly improved since ___. 
4. Unchanged mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 1 cm, 
likely reactive. 
5. Unchanged bilateral rib fractures including multiple 
contiguous mildly 
displaced fractures in the left lateral ribs. 
6. Unchanged appearance of the thoracic spine including omental 
compression fractures and sclerosis of the T3 vertebral body. 
7. Small hiatal hernia. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, the patient was electively admitted for a pipeline 
embolization of an aneurysm at left internal carotid/left 
posterior communicating artery bifurcation. She underwent this 
procedure with Dr. ___ without complication. She was 
transferred from the procedure suite to the PACU for 
post-procedure care and observation. She was later transferred 
to the ___ for close monitoring. Overnight, the patient had 
several episodes of transient aphasia noted to occur when she 
was hypotensive. She received multiple fluid boluses with good 
response. 

On ___, the patient's neurologic status remained stable. Her 
potassium was repleted. The arterial line and foley catheter 
were discontinued. During the morning, she was noted to have low 
O2 saturation levels which ranged in the high ___ and low ___ 
and requiring 2L of O2 NC which was a new requirement for her. A 
Chest x-ray was ordered and noted to be concerning for 
cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion. An ECHO was ordered which 
was negative for pericardial effusion. She was evaluated by the 
nurse practitioner in CT surgery who recommended a CTA of the 
chest for better evaluation. 

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable on 
examination. Overnight, she experienced a change in mental 
status and underwent a STAT CT of the head which was stable. She 
also underwent STAT labs which showed a drop in her hematocrit 
and hemoglobin. She also underwent a STAT CT/CTA of the chest 
which was stable but showed a slight enlargement of the 
bilateral pleural effusions. She was transferred to the ___ 
for close monitoring. She received a blood transfusion. 

On ___, the patient became tachypnic and increased shortness of 
breath as well as altered mental status in the morning. She was 
also noted to have a drop in her Hct. She underwent a CT head 
which was negative as well as a CTA torso which was stable. Her 
neurologic status returned to its baseline later in the morning. 


On ___, the patient remained hemodynamically and neurologically 
stable. Her H&H was up trending and her blood pressure goals 
remained 100-120. Her white blood cell count was down trending.

On ___, patient remains neurologically stable. Given blood 
pressure goals are 100-120, Norvasc was added to patients 
regimen. 

___, patient remains neurologically stable. Norvasc increased 
to maximum dose to control blood pressure. Medicine consulted 
for assistance in medication management. 

On ___, patient remains neurologically stable. Blood pressure 
controlled with titration of medications, physical therapy

Brief Hospital Course:
Presented with chest pain and underwent cardiac catheterization 
that revealed significant coronary artery disease.  Cardiac 
surgery was consulted and he underwent preoperative workup.  On 
___ was taken to the operating room  for coronary artery 
bypass graft surgery.  Please see operative report for further 
surgical details. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure 
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. He required 
vasoactive medications for blood pressure management that were 
weaned off post operative day one.  Early in the morning on post 
operative day one he was weaned from sedation, awoke 
neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.  
He was started on betablocker and diuretic, continued to 
progress and later that day was transferred to the floor.  
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy 
service for assistance with strength and mobility. He was 
postoperatively anemic, likely due to volume resuscitation, and 
he deferred transfusion. However on post operative day five he 
was feeling symptomatic on ambulation with increased fatigue and 
lightheadedness. He was transfused one unit of packed red blood 
cells, with resolution.  He continued to improve and was ready 
for discharge home with services on post operative day six.

STUDIES: 
=================================
CXR ___
1. Right IJ CVL tip in low SVC. 
2. Mild vascular congestion. 
3. New small retrocardiac opacity with small left pleural 
effusion is 
worrisome for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. 

CXR ___
In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has 
taken a much 
better inspiration.  Cardiac silhouette is now within normal 
limits, though there appears to be some increased elevation of 
pulmonary venous pressure.  Right IJ catheter again extends to 
the mid portion of the SVC. 

CXR ___
FINDINGS:  
Cardiac size is top normal.  Mild pulmonary edema is grossly 
unchanged.  
Bibasilar atelectasis larger on the right have minimally 
improved on the left. Right IJ catheter tip is in the cavoatrial 
junction.  .  There is no 
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
IMPRESSION:  
Mild pulmonary edema 

EGD ___
Findings: 
Esophagus: Normal esophagus. 
Stomach:  Excavated Lesions A 3mm focal ulceration was seen in 
the stomach body along the greater curvature.  
Duodenum: Excavated Lesions A 3cm ulcer with visible vessel was 
seen in the duodenal bulb, adjacent to the sweep.  BI-CAP 
Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.  
Other procedures: Cold forceps biopsies were performed for 
histology at the stomach antrum to evaluate for H.pylori.  

Impression: Gastric ulcer
Duodenal ulcer (thermal therapy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 

Recommendations: Continue high dose PPI BID. 
Follow up biopsy results. 

ECHO ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular 
systolic function is hyperdynamic (Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 
76%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II 
(moderate) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
left ventricular systolic function is more vigorous. There is 
progression of diastolic dysfunction from mild to moderate. 
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure can now be determined and is 
mildly increased. Other findings are similar.  

DISCHARGE LABS: 
==================================

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F w/ hx of an undefined myeloproliferative 
disorder on hydroxyurea and allopurinol, COPD, DM2, presenting 
with 2 weeks of diarrhea and lethargy, 1 week of dysuria and 
rash, admitted to ___ for shock.

FICU COURSE:
The patient was transferred from ___ with hypovolemic 
vs. distributive shock given infectious symptoms and poor PO 
intake for 1 week prior to admission. Her leukocytosis was 
chronic but profound to >100. Patient was evaluated by heme-onc 
who felt that elevation was likely a leukamoid response to 
infection and not evidence of transformation especially given 
lack of blasts on cell differential. She was given IV fluids and 
started on ciprofloxacin and flagyl initially for suspected 
GI/GU source given diarrhea and dysuria with positive UA. She 
was observed to be apneic with desaturations at night in the ICU 
and complained of SOB thought to be secondary to her COPD amd 
mild pulmonary edema requiring 4L O2 by NC. Urine cultures from 
outside hospital were positive for klebsiella. Her cipro was 
discontinued and started ceftriaxone per sensitivities on 
klebsiella. Stool studies were negative and urine culture at 
this hospital was negative. She was also noted to have a diffuse 
pruritic rash which dermatology evaluated and thought likely 
secondary to allopurinol or hydroxyurea so both of these 
medications were held. She improved and was transferred to the 
medical oncology floor for continued management but still with 
an O2 requirement of ___.

MEDICAL ONCOLOGY COURSE:
Upon arrival the patient was fatigued and requiring ___ of 
oxygen on NC. Her floor course was complicated by a GI bleed and 
___ in addition to her klebsiella UTI, dyspnea, and 
myeloproliferative disorder. Details by problem are as follows:

# Upper GI Bleed: Patient had an episode of melena followed by a 
sudden drop in her hematocrit. She required 5 units PRBCs from 
___. Initially she was unable to undergo EGD given O2 
requirement and risky intubation. Her O2 was weaned as her 
respiratory status improved. On ___ she underwent EDG which 
showed a bleeding duodenal ulcer that was treated with thermal 
therapy.   
- Cont PPI

#  Dyspnea: Patient presented with intermittent dyspnea, 
tachypnea, and hypoxia.  Likely multifactorial in the setting of 
some volume overload, reactive airway disease, COPD and likely 
OSA.  Patient does not seem to have an obvious COPD exacerbation 
currently and has never been treated with steroids for her COPD 
and does not require O2 at home.  No evidence of pulmonary 
infectious process per chest imaging.  Serial CXR's have been 
stable. She was treated with gentle diuresis for mild pulmonary 
edema and her O2 requirement decreased. She was also started on 
advair and given Levalbuterol & tiotropium prn. An ECHO was 
completed which showed possible diastolic dysfunction. See 
report for details.

# Thrombocytopenia: Patient developed thrombocytopenia likely 
secondary to myeloproliferative disorder given decrease in all 
cell lines.  Labs inconsistent with consumptive process. 
Unlikely to be ___ hydrea as this was d/c'd on ___. 

# UTI: Patient with Klebsiella UTI as described above. 
Trasnitioned from braod spectrum antibiotics to ceftriaxone (d1 
on ___ and then to cipro to be completed on ___. Her 
dysuria was resolved upon discharge. 

# Drug rash: Patient presented with diffuse pruritic rash as 
above without any mucosal involvement concerning for serious 
drug hypersensitivity reaction.  Presentation inconsistent with 
Sweet's. Dermatologic evaluation was likely a limited drug rash. 
Her allopurinol and hydroxyurea were stopped. She improved with 
triamcinolone 0.1% ointment BID to all affected areas sparing 
the face, axillae and groin and fexofenadine 180mg qAM for 
pruritus during the day and hydroxyzine at night as needed. 
Prior to discharge the rash completely resolved.

# ___: Patient with acute renal injury on admission with Cr up 
to 4.4. Likely pre-renal in the setting of hypovolemic shock as 
it resolved with fluid administration. Her medications were 
monitored and nephrotoxic agents avoided. Her home lisinopril 
was held. Cr was 0.8 on discharge. 

# Myeloproliferative disorder: BCR/ABL, JAK2 negative 
myeloprolifertive disorder (unclear what she has) dx a couple 
months ago on hydroxyurea for cytoreduction and allopurinol. Per 
BMT, initial worsening leukocytosis was not consistent with 
transformation.  Meds discontinued secondary to development of 
drug rash as described above.  Plan per Dr. ___ was to 
transition her to ruxolitinib. High risk for BLAST crisis.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
===========================
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: At home on metformin. HISS while in 
house
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home simvastatin
# Hypertension: Continued on atenolol once hypotension resolved. 

# Depression: Continued home escitalopram
# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
============================ 
- Observed apnea with desaturation while sleeping in the 
hospital, recommend outpatient sleep study for OSA.
-Home ___ to follow ambulatory oxygen saturation and 
endurance/safety on stairs in home
-Patient's home Lisinopril was stopped due to ___, consider 
restarting

ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
====================
# Myeloproliferative Disorder/MDS Overlap:
# Massive splenomegaly with splenic infarct
Currently on ___ and hydrea (alternating 500mg/1000mg). 
Now with enlarging spleen and new infarct. Given question of 
transformation to AML, she had a bone marrow biopsy ___, the 
results of which were pending at discharge. Will need to discuss 
treatment of splenomegaly with possible radiation as well as 
change in treatment regimen. Given that it seems she is not 
deriving much benefit from hydrea and ___, the decision 
was made to hold both of these treatment (including planned 
___ ___ until the results of her bone marrow biopsy 
are back. Her left upper quadrant pain was controlled with 
tramadol and completely resolved within 36 hours of her 
presentation. Given that the patient was eager to go home and we 
were not providing active treatment, the decision was made to 
discharge her with follow-up the week on ___. 

# Hyperuricemia 
Recent baseline uric acid ___. Patient with allergy to 
febuxostat and allopurinol which was reportedly a total body 
severe rash (worse with allopurinol). G6PD checked in ___ 
and was normal. She was started on fluids at 150cc/hr and was 
treated with rasburicase which lowered her uric acic dropped 
from 11.1 to 3.2. Other TLS/DIC were stable. 

# Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 1.3 on admission, baseline Cr 0.9-1.1. 
Concern for TLS vs. pre-renal. Back to baseline after IV fluids. 
Home lisinopril was held during the hospitalization and also 
held on discharge given that her blood pressures were as low as 
systolics of 100. 

The patient preliminarily has not transformed to AML, rather has 
splenic infarct.

mediastinal lymph nodes. 

___ TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM 
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic 
function is hyperdynamic (Quantitative (3D) LVEF = 79 %). The 
estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The 
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac 
output. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The 
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased 
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a 
very small pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: A left pleural effusion is present. Normal left 
ventricular wall thickness and cavity size with hyperdynamic 
regional/global systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation.

Placed on nasal cannula at 3L. Given 20mg IV Lasix without 
improvement in oxygenation and CTA negative for PE but 
significant for worsening pleural effusion and compression 
atelectasis. TTE with moderate pulmonary HTN but good systolic 
function despite elevated BNP. Troponin negative. No evidence of 
infection. Pulmonary consulted and felt most likely driver is 
effusion and atelectasis on substrate of COPD. CT Scan without 
contrast on ___ showed ground glass opacities and evidence of 
either pulmonary edema versus possible PCP PNA, though edema 
felt to be more likely. Chemical injury, infection, microembolic 
disease, and leukostasis all thought to be less likely. 
Beta-D-glucan positive on ___, but PCP on bronchoscopy was 
negative. Bronchoscopy showed negative viral panel and culture 
with commensal flora on culture. 

She underwent daily diuresis with 20mg IV Lasix with good urine 
output. She was also encouraged to frequently use incentive 
spirometer. On ___ her ambulatory oxygen saturation was 92-95% 
and her oxygen was discontinued. Presumed cause of her hypoxia 
is pulmonary edema and atelectasis. Although a TTE showed normal 
systolic function, it is possible that she has diastolic 
dysfunction that contributed to her volume overload. 

#Myeloproliferative disorder/MDS: 
#Elevated uric aicd
#Massive splenomegaly with splenic infarct
Presented on day 2 of cycle 1 of decitabine. Previously on 
___ and currently on hydrea at alternating doses of 
500mg/1000mg. Had bone marrow biopsy during recent admission 
showed known MPN with myelofibrosis with increased blasts of 7% 
(myeloid sequencing panel has shown mutations associated with 
MPN and MDS). She received three days of 2g of hydrea followed 
by two days of 1g of hydrea and her white blood count decresed 
from over 90 to 5.5. Hydrea was then discontinued in order to 
prevent caused significant cytopenia. 

She also has recently chronically high uric acid and received 
rasburicase during last admission due to allopurinol and 
fubuxostat allergies. She received rasburicase twice during this 
admission for a uric acid greater than 10. 

Her splenic pain from massive splenomegaly and likely splenic 
infarcts significantly worsened early in the admission requiring 
q6 oxycodone. However it spontaneously improved and by discharge 
she did not need any pain medication. She had her radiation 
mapping completed while hospitalized and will start radiation 
therapy on ___ at ___. Completion of her decitabine 
course will likely take place after radiation therapy.

=============
___ w/ MDS/MPN overlap (recent decitabine, hydrea & splenic 
XRT), T2DM, HTN, HFpEF, COPD (no home O2) who presented w/ 
progressive pancytopenia and new hemolysis and hemoglobinuria of 
unclear etiology with profound transfusion requirement.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
#PANCYTOPENIA
#HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA
Patient presented with fatigue and malaise. Work up notable for 
pancytopenia (___ nadir 90), hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. 
Peripheral smear showed only rare schistocytes. Direct and 
indirect Coombs tests were negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed 
marked fibrosis with myeloblasts consisting of <5% of 
cellularity. The etiology of the hemolysis remained unclear. 
Based on workup, unlikely to be immune-mediated hemolysis, 
drug-mediated or transfusion reaction. Tickborne workup showed 
negative babesia and lyme. She required ICU level care and 
received multiple units of blood products, and her hemolysis 
spontaneously resolved. She was transferred out of the ICU and 
started on acyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis given her 
low cell counts. She was discharged with plan for close follow 
up in ___ with repeat labs and transfusions PRN.

#Hemoglobinuria
Likely iso of hemolysis. Seen by urology in the ED with no 
urgent intervention indicated. GU ultrasound WNL. Had been on 
ceftriaxone in the ICU, which was discontinued when urine 
cultures came back negative.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
======================
#Type II Diabetes Mellitus: held home metformin. ISS while 
inpatient. Metformin was restarted on discharge.

#Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: received intermittent Lasix 
during admission while receiving transfusions. She was 
discharged on her home PO Lasix 20mg.

#Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine

#Hyperlipidemia: held simvastatin given concern for hemolysis. 

#COPD: continued home Spiriva

#Depression: continued home Lexapro

RESOLVED ISSUES
===================
#Anion gap metabolic acidosis -- resolved

#Hypokalemia -- resolved 

#Coagulopathy -- resolved

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
[ ] Acyclovir 400mg BID was started for prophylaxis

splenic infarcts, recently re-started on jackafi with plan for
venatoclax initiation admitted for worsening TLS and hypoxemia.

Regarding recent oncologic history, was previously on ___
however had worsening splenomegaly with spenic infarcts. She was 

subsequently switched from vidaza to dacogen and previously
underwent splenic radiation. Was receiving dacogen as an
outpatient with frequent PRBC transfusions.

She subsequently had worsening leukocytosis and was recently
started on hydrea, however now with worsening thrombocytopenia.
She was re-started on dacgoen, however complicated by recurrent

differential showed immature myeloid forms. There was mild 
basophilia and hypersegmented neutrophils. The remainder of her 
CBC was unremarkable. The CBC was repeated and the results are 
similar and an urgent referral to Hematology was placed.  
- ___: First hematology visit. Presentation 
initially appeared consistent with chronic phase CML. However, 
the BCR-ABL PCR and the JAK2 mutation analysis were negative.  
- ___: Bone marrow Bx which showed markedly 
hypercellualrl marrow for age with trilenage hematopoiesis with 
increased megas, 0% blasts, concerning for MPN. Cytogenetics 
showed a ___ female karyotype and the FISH MDS panel was 
negative for the common cytogenetic abnormalities observed  
within myelodysplastic syndrome. There was no FISH evidence of 
BCR-ABL gene rearrangement. Flow cytometry was performed, which 
showed a 1% subset of blasts, that expressed CD34, CD33, HLA-TR 
and lacked CD19, CD14, and CD56. Additional testing for SETBP1 
and CSF3R were negative, these are mutations sometimes seen with 
atypical CML and also chronic neutrophilic leukemia. As she was 
symptomatic, she was put on hydrea 500 mg daily and allopurinol.
- ___: Underwent eye surgery. The following day, she 
developed diarrhea and rash. 
- ___: Admitted to ___ and transferred to 
___
on the next day. The patient was in septic shock and admitted to
the MICU. Further workup showedpneumonia. During her
hospitalization, white blood cell count rose to greater than
100,000 and was felt to be consistent with a leukemoid reaction. 
In the hospital, she had a massive upper GI bleed and had a 
bleeding duodenal ulcer that was treated with laser coagulation. 
She was discharged to a rehab facility on ___. She 
started Jakafi at some point AFTER discharge.
- ___ through ___: She was readmitted to ___

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is ___ female with history of MPD/MDS overlap 
syndrome with massive splenomegaly requiring frequent 
transfusions and with splenic infarcts, previously on dacogen 
and hydrea recently re-started on vida___ who presented with 
worsening abdominal pain, hypoxemia requiring 4L O2 and ___. 
Found to have mild pulmonary edema with hypoxemic respiratory 
failure initially attributed to acute on chronic HFpEF in the 
setting of requiring frequent transfusions for her MPD/MDS in 
the outpatient setting. Hopsital course was complicated by 
worsening hypoxemia to 6L O2 requirement despite adequate 
diuresis with net negative 12.8L length of stay. Her O2 was 
eventually able to be weaned to 3L, thought to primarily be 
attributed to her severe splenomegaly. For her MPD/MDS, she was 
re-started on jakafi and hydroxyurea was up-titrated to 500mg 
BID. She required frequent PRBC with lasix and platelet 
transfusions. Was also treated for 2 UTIs, first a pan-sensitive 
klebsiella UTI and second zosyn-sensitive UTI, ultimately 
discharged on cipro per AST recommendations. 

ACUTE ISSUES
===============
#Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
#Volume Overload - With history of MDS/MPD and COPD presenting 
with hypoxemic respiratory failure initially requiring 4L O2. 
Admission CXR showing mild pulmonary edema. Hypoxemia was 
thought to be secondary to acute on chronic HFpEF in the setting 
of frequent transfusions required in the outpatient setting for 
her MDS/MPD. Was diuresed with intermittent lasix 40 IV boluses 
and was net negative 12.8L length of stay. Hospitalization was 
complicated by worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure to 6L, 
however was subsequently able to be weaned to 3L O2 prior to 
discharge. TTE showed some mild symetric LVH with normal cavity 
size and regional/global biventricular systolic function. It was 
noted she had a calcific AV with mild AR and moderate TR with 
moderate pHTN. Her 3L O2 requirement in large part was 
attributed to her severe splenomegaly and poor diaphragmatic 
movement. She was ultimately discharged on 3L O2 home with 
maximal services. 

#MDS/MPD
#Leukocytosis
#Thrombocytopenia
#Anemia - History of MPD/MDS overlap syndrome with massive 
splenomegaly requiring frequent transfusions and with splenic 
infarcts, previously on dacogen and hydrea recently re-started 
on vidaza followed by Dr. ___. During hospitalization was 
started on ___. Unfortunately WBC up-trended to peak 182,000. 
Given her allergy to allopurinol, patient was started on 
hydroxyurea. Prior to discharge hydroxyurea was titrated to 
500mg BID. While on 1G BID, her WBC down-trended however was 
complicated by worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia. Prior to 
discharge her hydrea was titrated from 500QD to 500 BID with WBC 
on discharge 57.6. As per extensive goals of care conversations, 
patient wishing to continue with transfusions at this time. 
Required frequent PRBC and platelet transfusions, of note with 
difficult cross match to PRBC given numerous antibodies to 
PRBCs. Discharge Hb 7.2 and PLT 12, received an additional unit 
of PRBC and PLT given follow-up arranged on ___ for next CBC 
check.

#Abdominal pain - Presented with worsening LUQ abdominal pain 
thought to be secondary to known severe splenomegaly. Abdominal 
US showed corase hepatic parenchyma suggesting fibrosis with 
marked splenomegaly 27.9 cm. Abdominal pain subsequently 
improved on oxycontin 10mg PO bid and oxycodone 5mg PO Q4H:PRN.

___ - Presented with ___ with Cr 1.3 on admission. Was thought 
to be secondary to hyperuricemia with uric acid 10.9 on 
admission. Received 2 doses of rasburicase however uric acid did 
not trend downwards. ___ have had possible pre-renal component 
given relatively poor PO intake, Cr down-trended to normal with 
blood product administration. Cr on discharge 1.3. Likely 
slightly volume contracted in the setting of aggressive 
diuresis, however taking into consideration risk/benefit ratio 
of keeping slightly volume down as she will require frequent 
blood product administration with her hypoxemic respiratory 
failure. 

#Hyperuricemia - With elevated uric acid 10.9 on admission, 
received 2 doses of rasburicase, however uric acid did not trend 
down-wards and did not meet guidelines for ___ additional dose 
given Cr did not rise >1.8. Was initially hypokalemic and 
without hypocalcemia not supporting TLS. Her phosphate trended 
up-wards to 9.2 for which she was started on sevelamir, however 
clinical picture was not entirely consistent with TLS. 

# Recurring UTI - Found to have symptomatic pan-sensitive 
klebsiella UTI on ___ for which she was treated with CTX x 5 
days. On ___, still was complaining of persistent urinary 
symptoms that was largely resistant, sensitive to zosyn and 
intermediate to cipro. In discussion with AST, decision was made 
to treat with zosyn inpatient and was determined acceptable to 
treat with cipro for 7 day course total through ___. Given 
intermediate sensitivity, patient will require close follow-up 
in outpatient setting to continue to monitor for urinary 
symptoms and/or fever. 

#Goals of care - After extensive goals of care conversations 
with patient and primary oncologists Dr. ___ elected 
to continue with cancer directed treatment. She also still 
expressed that ongoing transfusions are within her goals of 
care. With poor prognosis given her worsening hypoxemic 
respiratory failure. Arrangements were made for a discharge home 
with plan for patient to follow-up with primary oncologists 
approximately 3 times per week for ongoing transfusions. Patient 
was instructed to return to the Emergency Department if 
worsening shortness of breath or hypoxemia.

CHRONIC ISSUES
=================
#Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Home metformin 850mg PO QD was 
initially held during admission, placed on ISS while inpatient. 

#Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine 88mcg PO QD

#Hyperlipidemia: Simvastatin initially held due to concern for 
hemolysis, was resumed on discharge. 

#Depression: Continued home Lexapro

#GERD - Cont home Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H

ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the 
basal to mid inferior wall. The remaining segments contract 
normally (LVEF = 55 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is a mild 
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was transferred from outside hospital after cardiac 
cath revealed an ostial LAD lesion. Upon admission he received 
medical management while undergoing surgical work-up and 
awaiting Plavix wash-out. On ___ he was brought to the operating 
room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 1. 
Please see operative note for surgical details. Following 
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring 
in stable condition. Later this day he was weaned from sedation, 
awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed 
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to 
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and 
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The 
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.  He had significant pain 
post-operatively and was managed with Dilaudid, Neurontin and 
Toradol.  He is advised to continue ibuprofen for 1 week, as 
well as a lidocaine patch for shoulder pain. He developed 
drainage from the superior sternal pole.  He will be discharged 
with swabs/daily dressing changes and an early wound check.  By 
the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating 
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral 
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good condition 
with appropriate follow up instructions.

ECHO ___
The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrial volume index 
is normal. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF = 65%). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion 
(bounce and shudder) suggestive of pericardial constriction. 
Presystolic ejection across the pulmonic valve is present 
(suggestive of constriction). The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive 
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
findings are now suggestive of early pericardial constriction.  

Nuclear ETT ___:  
FINDINGS:  Left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a fixed perfusion defect 
in the basilar portion of the inferior, likely representing 
attenuation.  Otherwise, uniform tracer uptake throughout the 
left ventricular myocardium. 
  
Gated images reveal normal wall motion including the basilar 
portion of the interior wall. 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 58%. 
  
IMPRESSION:  1.  Normal cardiac perfusion study.  2.  Normal 
left ventricular cavity size and ejection fraction. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with CAD s/p PCIx3 and recent CABG x1 (LIMA->LAD) on ___,

On arrival to the ED, patient's symptoms had completely 
resolved. EKG was obtained which showed new inverted T-waves, 
initial troponin level <0.01 and repeat <0.01. He underwent an 
ECHO on ___ that demonstrates constrictive physiology. 
Cardiology has been consulted and a stress test has been ordered 
per their recommendation.
His stress test was negative for ischemia and Dr. ___ spoke to 
the pt's cardiologist, Dr. ___ felt the patient could 
go home on ___ and see him in the office in follow up.

CT chest: Small left pneumothorax, and nonhemorrhagic pleural
effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Multiple left-sided rib, 
nondisplaced fractures involving the second through sixth ribs 
laterally

CT head: negative 

___ CXR: 
1.  No pneumothorax. 
2.  Interval increase in left-sided pleural effusion, which is 
now small to moderate size. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ multitrauma, transfer from OSH status post fall down 14 
stairs, +ETOH. Injuries include left sided pneumothorax, left 
anterior ___ rib fractures and left posterior ___ fractures, 
who became hypoxic in the ED and is status post left chest 
needle decompression and pigtail placement. The patient was 
admitted to the TSICU for continuous oxygen saturation 
monitoring, pain control, CIWA, serial chest xrays, and close 
respiratory monitoring/pulmonary toilet. Acute Pain Service was 
consulted and an epidural was placed for pain management. 

ON HD1, the patient self-discontinued her chest tube. A 
post-pull cxr did not reveal any new or increasing pneumothorax. 
 On HD2, the epidural was removed and the patient was converted 
to oral pain medication. The patient was hemodynamically stable 
and transferred out of the TSICU to the floor. On HD3  Physical 
therapy evaluated the patient and felt she was safe to return 
home without any services. 

During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and 
frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive 
spirometry, and actively 
participated in the plan of care. The patient received  
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this 
stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan. She had follow-up scheduled in the ___ 
clinic.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after sustaining injuries from a 
fall. You you fractured your fractured multiple ribs on the left 
side and injured your lung, requiring a chest tube be placed. 
You were admitted for pain control, close respiratory 
monitoring, and chest tube management. The chest tube has been 
removed and your pain is under control with oral analgesia. Your 
vital signs are stable, and you are medically cleared for 
discharge home to continue your recovery. Please note the 
following discharge instructions: 

* Your injury caused rib fractures which can cause severe pain 
and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of 
the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily (e.g Colace and/or 
Senna) and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible. If 
you do not have a bowel movement in the next couple of days, you 
can take a laxative such as Milk of Magnesia or Miralax as 
needed. 
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

It was a pleasure taking care of you

poorly differentiated pancreatic cancer. Patient had a lot of 
pain, both from pancreatic mass and intraperitoneal bleed. 
Patient's case reviewed by liver tumor board and deemed not a 
candidate for surgery. Patient's functional status also too poor 
to begin chemotherapy. After multiple family meetings and goals 
of care discussions patiently ultimately made DNR/DNI and 
discharged home with hospice. 

# UGIB: Hbg 15 at baseline, 9.9 on presentation. Intubated on 
admission ___ setting of hematemesis. On admission (___) 
underwent ___ without clear bleed, but embolization of artery 
(GDA) invaded by tumor. Continued to bleed however, with EGD 
showing gastric varicies, which were glued on ___. However, 
continued bleeding, with CTA on ___ showing re-bleed of 
varicies. Went to ___ on ___ with stenting of thrombosed splenic 
vein, ___ attempt to relieve the splenic HTN which was leading to 
the gastric varicies. However, continued to bleed on ___, with 
EGD showing no bleed from varicies. CT A/P showed bleed into 
splenic capsule/peritoneum from site where splenic stent had 
been placed through the day prior; splenic stent had thrombosed 
___ this interval. Underwent embolization of spleen with 
cessation of bleeding. Pancreatobiliay surgery had been 
consulted ___ the setting of these recurrent bleeds; did not feel 
patient was surgical candidate. On pantoprazole gtt and 
octreotide gtt (total 5 days), and then transitioned to PPI BID. 
___ total recieved 12 U PBRBCs, 2 U FFP, 1 U platelets.

# Direct Hyperbiliruminemia: Unclear etiology from turmor burden 
versus possible medication effect as patient was on ceftriaxone 
for treatment of PNA. Elevated direct bilirubinemia along with 
rising LFTs and WBC raised concern for possible obstructive 
process and/or cholangitis. Patient switched from ceftriaxone to 
zosyn after which LFTs downtrended. CT Abdomen showed no 
evidence of biliary dilitation and MRCP also w/o evidence of 
biliary obstruction or cholangitis. Bilirubin normalized at time 
of discharge.

# Pneumonia: VAP vs aspiration pneumonia ___ setting of 
hematemesis. Intubated ___ setting of hematemesis/need for 
intevention, but remained intubated for several days due to

on ___, eventually narrowed to ceftriaxone on ___, with plan 
for ___ut patient switched to zosyn (___) after 
concern for possible gastrointestinal infection.

# Pain control: Has ongoing abdominal pain likely component of 
tumor pain but primarily due to hemoperitoneum. ___ ICU pain 
controlled with MS ___ and dilaudid PCA. After transfer to 
oncology med floor patient, PCS discontinued, written for IV 
dilaudid prn, and eventually transitioned to Fetanyl patch with 
PO dilaudid for breakthrough pain.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a very pleasant, ___ female who has a 
past medical and past surgical history significant for right 
breast carcinoma and status post mastectomy.She developed a left 
breast carcinoma in ___ underwent lumpectomy followed by 
radiation therapy. In ___ developed another left breast 
carcinoma and this was excised with wide local excision under 
wide localexcision only protocol.She recently developed a new 
diagnosis of left breast invasive ductal carcinoma,grade 2, ER 
positive, HER-2/neu negative. We discussed surgical options for 
management to be mastectomy. We discussed we would perform a 
sentinel lymph node biopsy after the discussion at

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
=====================
In brief this is a ___ yo female with hx of breast cancer s/p 
bilateral mastectomy, HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism, type II DM, 
recent left MCA stroke, AF on dabigatran, mixed 
systolic-diastolic CHF (EF 42% on ___, admitted from urgent 
visit for orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, decreased appetite 
and trouble swallowing, became acutely hypotensive on ___ 
secondary to multietiology shock that resolved with addressing 
of underlying etiologies described below. Patient stabilized and 
called out to cardiology service where she underwent diuresis 
with improvement in BNP and mental status. Her course was 
complicated by persistent a fib with RVR for which she was 
placed on digoxin and low dose metoprolol with good response. 
She underwent PEG tube placement due to poor PO intake, though 
she was cleared for pureed foods by the speech team. She was 
discharged to rehab. She may benefit  from cardioversion once on 
anticoagulation for appropriate duration. 

ACUTE PROBLEMS:
===============
# HFrEF (EF 23%)
# Tachymyopathy vs. ischemic cardiomyopathy
Patient presented with poor PO intake/failure to thrive and 
received volume resuscitation. This, in conjunction with 
unidentified newly reduced ejection fraction, likely triggered 
subsequent Afib with RVR. Rate control was attempted with 
metoprolol. This precipitated cardiogenic shock requiring brief 
admission to the MICU. On TTE she was found to have newly 
reduced EF of 23% (compared to prior 42%) with global 
hypokinesis most likely from tachymyopathy due to poorly 
controlled atrial fibrillation prior to this admission. Missed 
ischemic event was considered but cardiac cath was not pursued 
due to frailty. Was trialed on Lasix boluses and subsequently 
bumex gtt prior to transfer from ICU. On transfer to the floor, 
patient was continued on lasix gtt and converted to PO Lasix 
when euvolemic. She was started on digoxin for rate control of 
afib (see below). Afterload reduction was managed with 
captopril. She was eventually tolerating low-dose metoprolol 
after rate control with digoxin. Discharge weight was 136 
pounds. She will follow up with cardiology NP in one week and 
Dr. ___. 

# Atrial fibrillation
First diagnosed in ___ after suffering from stroke. 
CHADSVASC of 8. She was prescribed Diltiazem prior to this 
admission. Upon arrival she was found to have afib with RVR in 
the low 100s and she was volume depleted. With volume repletion 
and uptitration of metoprolol for rate control, she became 
hypotensive. All rate control was held. She was subsequently 
started on digoxin for rate control, and low-dose metoprolol was 
subsequently added and tolerated. Due to intermittent swallowing 
issues/pocketing meds in her mouth, home dabigatran had to be 
converted to apixaban so that she could receive it via her PEG 
tube. During this hospitalization she was considered for 
cardioversion but she had reportedly missed some doses of her 
anticoagulation prior to admission. Going forward, she may 
benefit from cardioversion. She has consistently been 
anticoagulated since ___ (she was on it prior to that but it 
was held briefly for her PEG tube placement). At discharge she 
was still in atrial fibrillation but with heart rates in the 
___. 

# ___
Cr peaked at 2.4 with limited urine output. FeNA suggestive with 
prerenal
etiology, consistent with cardiorenal as driving etiology with 
contribution from ATN from shock described above. Her creatinine 
improved to 0.8 at the time of discharge.

# Coagulopathy
Unclear etiology. liver function seems normal. Vitamin K 
challenge 5 IV x3 days with minimal improvement. 

# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy
# Delirium
Recent stroke, likely acute delirium iso critical illness. CT
head negative. She became quite hypernatremic after starting 
tube feeds, which correlated with her cognitive decline. She 
improved substantially after correction of her serum sodium but 
still remained occasionally disoriented to place/time.

# Failure to thrive
# Concern for dysphagia 
# Weight loss
No clear etiology, as decreased PO intake and weight loss began 
prior to recent stroke. Patient's function and PO intake have 
appeared to continuously worsen since stroke. CT 
abd/pelvis/chest ___ with no e/o malignancy or occult 
infection. Per discussion w/daughter, daughter would like to 
maximize nutrition (including tube feeds) given this is an acute 
decline. The patient was evaluated by the speech and swallow 
time and was cleared for pureed solids and thin liquids. It was 
decided that she could take in whatever desired PO that she 
would like, and that would be supplemental to tube feeding. She 
underwent PEG placement on ___ and was started on bolus tube 
feeds 3x daily. Tube feeds should not be given 2 hours prior to 
AM levothyroxine or two hours after levothyroxine in order to 
allow maximum drug absorption. 

# C diff
Patient developed diarrhea in early ___. C diff stool PCR was 
positive. She completed a 10 day course of PO vancomycin: 
___. She was no longer symptomatic at discharge.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: 
======================
# OSA
Has diagnosis of severe OSA, on BIPAP at home though compliance
is unclear. She should continue BiPAP at ___ nightly. 

# Left MCA stroke with dysarthria and right hemiparesis on 
___
NCHCT from ___ showed sequela of recent L MCA infarction. No 
evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. She has right sided 
hemiparesis. Continue atorvastatin 40 mg PO daily 

# Type II diabetes mellitus
Restart home metformin and glipizide at discharge. Her blood 
glucose was appropriate on 10 units of Lantus daily, but this 
may require adjustment once she gets on a regular schedule of 
bolus tube feeds.

# Hypothyroidism
Continue home levothyroxine 75 mcg daily. TSH and FT4 were 
checked and were appropriate. Tube feeds should be held two 
hours prior to AM dose and two hours after AM dose to allow 
maximum absorption.

# GERD
Continue pantoprazole 40 mg daily 

# Anemia
She is a ___ Witness and cannot receive blood products. 

# Hypertension
Continue captopril, consider changing to lisinopril 2.5. She did 
not tolerate higher doses of lisinopril in-house and became 
hypotensive.

=========================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=========================
[ ] Discharge weight: 136 pounds
[ ] Discharge diuretic: Lasix 20 mg daily
[ ] Diltiazem was discontinued and should not be restarted due 
to her reduced ejection fraction.
[ ] Dabigatran was switched to apixaban because dabigatran 
cannot be given through PEG tube and she occasionally pockets 
medications in her mouth.
[ ] Consider switching captopril to lisinopril. In the past she

K-3.3 Cl-107 HCO3-26 AnGap-___ with PMH Alzheimer's dementia, diabetes, coming from OSH for 
altered mental status, leukocytosis, hypernatermia and 
hyperglycemia likely due to pneumonia.  She was initially 
admitted to the ICU and then transferred to the floor.

# Hypernatremia: She appeared to have hypovolemic hypernatremia 
based on clinical exam findings of dry mucous membranes, 
significant respiratory variation in IVC diameter, and IJ 
collapse with respiratory variation.  This is likely 
multifactorial in the setting of worsening mental status related 
to infection in combination with dementia. Pt was calculated to 
have a free water deficit of ~5L. Her hypernatremia was 
gradually corrected over the course of 2.5 days with ___ NS 
after volume resuscitation with LR.  Her sodium was monitored 
daily and remained within the normal range. Would continue to 
monitor weekly while at rehab and encourage liquid intake.

# HCAP: On presentation, pt had worsening mental status, 
leukocytosis, and CXR c/w possible left lower lobe PNA.  She had 
a new O2 requirement as well.  She was started on vanc, zosyn, 
and azythromycin. She completed an 8 day course on ___.  
PICC was removed prior to discharge.  Over the course of her 
stay in the ICU, her O2 requirement resolved. At discharge she 
was afebrile, oxygen saturation in high ___ on room air 
breathing comfortably, some improving rhonchi at bases. 

# Nutrition/Goals of Care: It was suspected that her subacute 
weight loss is due to her dementia. She was seen by speach and 
swallow who provided diet recommendations. Also recent 
malnutrition due to acute illess. The issue of inadequate 
nutrition in patients with progressive dementia was discussed 
with her son ___. We dicussed adding high calorie supplements 
to her diet and asssitance with feeding. He will consider using 
an appetite stimulant with her outpatient providers. We 
discussed that there is no evidence that tube feeding will 
improve quality or longevity of life, which he recognized saying 
that he had dealt with similar issues with his father's chronic 
progressive illness and ultimately passing. 
DIET: 
Regular; Diabetic/Consistent Carbohydrate Consistency: Pureed 
(dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids Supplement: Glucerna 
shake breakfast, lunch, dinner pills crushed in puree. 
Aspiration precautions, please provide assistance with feeding. 

# HTN: Pt was mildly hypotensive on arrival and required volume 
resuscitation; metoprolol was therefore held. These were later 
restarted.

# Depression: she was continued on her home dose of 20mg 
citalopram.

# H/o CVA: She was continued on her home simva 20 and ASA 81.

#Anemia: Patient hematocrit trended down during hospitalization 
to 25. Labs were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. 
Hematocrit remained stable at 25. 

Code status: Full code, although son ___ is HCP and 
reconsidering and would continue to address goals of care

TRANSITIONAL: 
-monitor electrolytes (potassium, sodium)
-monitor CBC for recovery of RBC count
-add high calorie supplements to meals, assistance with feedings

History of Present Illness:
___ with h/o DM2, HLD who was transferred from an outside 
hospital for acute pancreatitis, intubated. The patient's family 
wanted a second opinion for management of his acute 
pancreatitis.

Pt initially presented to ___ ___ w nausea 
vomitting and abdominal pain. He was noted to have an elevated 
lipase of 3000. CT abd showed pancreatic stranding consistent w 
acute pancreatitis. His vitals on admission were 97.3 113 148/78 
95% ra. He had an initial WBC of 12.6. 

He was seen by GI, who suggested aggressive hydration and 
discontinuation of Januvia and Clozaril (though this was 
restarted per psych at a lower dose). Triglycerides were 334 on 
___. His lipase was improving by then but on ___, the patient 
had elevated Tbili of 11.6 on ___. He had an abd US that showed 
normal gallbladder, no biliary dilitation. ___ was called to see 
the patient and an ERCP was done showing edematous duodenum with 
a smooth stricture about 2 cm was found, thought to be from 
pancreatic edema from pancreatitis. A stent was placed and dark 
sludge was seen.  The patient's Tbili improved to 3 but then 
rose to 7.7 on ___. A repeat ERCP was done, which showed 
displacement of plastic stent and a ___ CBD stricture, so a 
metallic stent (10 mm diameter and 6 cm long) was placed. 

His course was complicated by a blood culture on ___ that 
showed pansensitive E.coli. He was initially placed on Zosyn but 
de-escalated to Levaquin after sensitivites returned. Subsequent 
BCx on ___ was also negative. 

Later in his hospital course, he was noted to have had 
stridorous respirations. He had a 6 x 3 cm hardened dark brown 
foreign body on top of the glottis that was removed. The patient 
was having worsening stridor, so he was intubated. He had 
hypotension and was started on levophed, but this has since been 
weaned. He has been intermittently febrile and had most recently 
received vancomycin and meropenem though blood cultures appeared 
to be negative. 

There was a mention in the discharge summary of a pseudocyst 
imaged on CT abd/pelvis that was new since imaging performed on 
___. 

Of note, the patient had episodes of agitation requiring Haldol 
5 mg q4h plus Ativan. He had required Precedex for agitation.

level of the carina. Mild basilar atelectatic changes without 
evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.  There may 
well be a small right pleural effusion. 

CXR ___:
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is and 
placement of a Dobbhoff tube, the tip of which extends just 
below the esophagogastric junction. It should be pushed forward 
at least 10 cm if possible. 

ECG ___:
Sinus rhythm. Leftward axis. Late R wave progression. Compared 
to the 
previous tracing of ___ the limb lead voltage is now less. 
Otherwise, 
probably no change. 

CT abd/pelvis ___:
1. The pancreatic necrotic collection has walled-off since 
___. Portal venous system including the portal vein, 
superior mesenteric vein, and splenic vein are patent.  A common 
bile duct stent has been placed. 
2. There is persistent bilateral pleural effusion and bibasilar 
atelectasis. 
3. The multiple large renal cysts in the left kidney and a small 
hypodensity in the right kidney are unchanged since ___. 


Abd US and duplex doppler ___:
Necrotizing pancreatitis with Doppler flow in the superior 
mesenteric vein, portal vein and the majority of the splenic 
vein. No definite flow could be identified within the mid 
portion of the splenic vein, which may be technical, as recent 
CT scan showed small calibre but opacification of this vessel. 

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  
As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is 
seen. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the 
carinal.  The lung volumes remain low.  No pleural effusions.  
No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  The 
previously placed Dobbhoff catheter has been removed. 

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  
LUNG LOW IN VOLUME BUT CLEAR. SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL ABNORMALITY, 
ALONG THE RIGHT LATERAL COSTAL MARGIN CORRESPONDS TO THE SMALL 
PLEURAL EFFUSION EFFUSION SEEN ON ABDOMEN CT ___. TODAY 
THERE IS THE SUGGESTION OF A NONDISPLACED FRACTURE AT THE 
LATERAL ASPECT OF THE RIGHT SIXTH RIB, BUT THAT FINDING IS NOT 
PRESENT ON ANY OF THE PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPHS OR THE ABDOMEN CT 
SO IT MAY BE ARTIFACTUAL. 
NO PNEUMOTHORAX. NORMAL CARDIOMEDIASTINAL SILHOUETTE. 

CT Head ___:
IMPRESSION:   
No acute intracranial process. 

___
CT abd/pelvis with contrast
IMPRESSION: 
1. No significant change in the walled pancreatic necrotic fluid 
collection compared with ___ CT exam.
2. Interval enlargement of the spleen with severe compromise of 
the splenic vein and increasing collateral return via the 
gastrocolic trunk suggests development of sinistral portal 
venous hypertension.
3. Increased mucosal enhancement in the rectum may reflect 
infectious or
inflammatory colitis/proctitis.

___ CXR: 
Progressive elevation of the right lung base coupled with 
worsening 
consolidation in the lower lung suggests severe atelectasis. 
There is also moderate right pleural effusion. The right 
bronchial tree is poorly 
defined. The findings suggest large scale aspiration or 
difficulty clearing secretions.  Left lung is clear.  Left heart 
border is normal. 
Left PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC. 

___ CXR: 
Endotracheal tube has been removed.  The feeding tube and 
left-sided PICC line are unchanged in position. There are mildly 
low lung volumes. There is no focal consolidation. There is mild 
atelectasis at the lung bases. There are no pneumothoraces. 

___ CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received 
a nasogastric tube. The tip of the tube is located in pre 
pyloric position. The middle parts of the tube are slightly 
coiled in the stomach. The left PICC line is unchanged.  No 
evidence of complications, no pneumothorax.  No pleural 
effusions.  No pneumonia. 

___ CXR:
In comparison with the study of ___, the left subclavian 
catheter has been pulled back to the region of the junction of 
the brachiocephalic vein with the superior vena cava. Otherwise 
little change. 

___ CXR:
In comparison with the study of ___, there has been 
placement of a new left PICC line extends to the mid to lower 
portion of the SVC. Otherwise, little change in the appearance 
of the heart and lung and no evidence of acute abnormality. 

___ Abdominal XR:
The nasogastric tube has unfolded, remaining within the stomach, 
likely 
terminating within the antrum or pylorus.  A biliary stent is 
present.  
Included views of the lung bases are clear. A normal bowel gas 
pattern is 
demonstrated. 

___ Right Rib XR:
No fracture or dislocation.

___ CT A/P pancreas protocol:
1. Absence of pneumobilia is concerning for CBD stent occlusion. 
Superior 
migration of the common bile duct stent, now external to the 
duodenal lumen, in comparison to ___ CT with 
duodenal wall within the inferior margin of the stent, is likely 
etiology for obstruction. Differential includes stricture at the 
level of the ampulla. 
2.  Increased necrosis of a chronic pancreatic collection with 
increased gas and slightly more organized adjacent collections 
within the pancreatic head. 
4. Patent vasculature with persistent narrowing of the SMV, 
splenic vein, and portal confluence. No thrombus. 
5. Evidence of pancreatitis with heterogeneous enhancement of 
pancreatic head/ uncinate and edema within the 
pancreaticoduodenal groove. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o with PMH significant for type 2 
diabetes, schizoaffective d/o, transferred from OSH for acute 
pancreatitis c/b E.coli bacteremia, intermittent fevers, and 
acute respiratory failure. ___ course further complicated by 
malignant catatonia and recurrent aspiration.

# Malignant catatonia - Was on ativan and clozapine and 
clozapine at home for schizoeffective disorder. Clozaril was 
stopped at OSH given concern for pancreatitis. Agitation was 
originally managed with IV haldol in the ICU, but the patient 
developed muscle rigidity and near-catatonia with perseveration. 
Psych was consulted, who felt that his presentation was 
consistent with malignant catatonia and was likely secondary to 
cessation of clozaril. He was started on IV ativan but his 
catatonia appeared to be refractory to benzodiazpine treatment. 
He was then started on a regimen of ECT ___. Amantadine was 
added at 100mg po BID. With these measures, his catatonia 
resolved. He received 8 total sessions of ECT while inpatient at 
___. His amantadine was weaned to 100mg daily, and his ativan 
was left at 2mg po every 8 hours. On discharge the patient was 
alert and oriented to person, place, and time with occasional 
confusion about date and hospital name. He will need maintenance 
ECT therapy weekly on ___ for an indeterminate amount of 
time. His outpatient psychiatrist has been closely involved. His 
next treatment is at ___ on ___. ***Ativan should be held 
past midnight on scheduled ECT days.

# Acute respiratory failure - Patient had stridorous 
respirations at the OSH. He was found to have a 6x3 cm hardened, 
dark brown material c/w hardened or dried oral secretion, which 
was removed. He remained stridorous after the procedure and was 
intubated for concern of airway protection, which was performed 
___ prior to transfer. CXR showed no infiltrates and no 
pulmonary edema. Here he was successfully extubated on ___ and 
was stable for a week.  He was called-out to the floor on ___, 
and within two hours was stridorous, and a respiratory code was 
called. He was re-intubated and bronchoscopy revealed mucous 
plug and thick secretions.  He was started on vanc/cefipime and 
was extubated about 12 hours later.  Antibiotics were d/c'd two 
days later because infection was not suspected.  He was 
transferred back to the MICU again to await ECT given concern 
for decreased airway protection in his catatonic state. He was 
intubated by anesthesia with rocuronium on ___ prior to first 
ECT session. Remained intubated for several hours following 
procedure given his h/o difficult intubation. Patient was 
transitioned back to the medical floor on ___ with stable 
respiratory status. On the night of ___ he became febrile to 
___ and developped respiratory distress requiring 
non-rebreather. An interval Chest X-ray was suggestive of 
aspiration pneumonia.  He was transferred back to the MICU in 
the morning of ___, where he was intubated and sedated. Broad 
spectrum antibiotics were given. His respiratory status improved 
over several days, and his fevers resolved. His respiratory 
culture was positive for MRSA, so antibiotics were narrowed to 
Vancomycin monotherapy. He was exubated on ___, and was 
progressively weaned to 2L nasal cannula. Once called out to the 
medical floor, the patient re-spiked a fever so cefepime was 
added back on with vanc to complete a total 7 day course for 
aspiration PNA (ending ___. Patient was weaned to room air. 
The patient was made strict NPO due to aspiration risk. S&S was 
consulted who recommended a dysphagia diet. Pt was also started 
on tube feeds while PO intake was limited. Nutrition and speech 
and swallow continued to follow. Eventually, he passed speech 
and swallow eval and was able to advance to a regular diet. Tube 
feeds were then discontinued. It is felt that the patient's 
aspiration event was likely secondary to airway edema from 
multiple intubations, and that his edema has healed over time 
with subsequent improvement in ability to protect his airway. He 
was discharged on a regular diet, on room air, and without any 
respiratory concerns. Nutrition should continue to follow his 
caloric intake. Aspiration precautions should be enforced.

# Acute pancreatitis c/b pseudocyst, necrosis, and sinistral 
portal hypertension - Etiology appears to be biliary source 
although clozapine was considered as a pharmacalogic etiology. 
ERCP did not show gallstones and only sludge. Now s/p ERCP x2 at 
___. Initially a plastic stent was placed which 
migrated. It was removed and a metal stent was placed on ___. 
LFTs and Tbili improved during hospitalization. Repeat CT 
Abdomen ___ revealed massive splenomegaly concerning for 
sinitral portal hypertension. Hepatobiliary surgery and 
Hepatology were consulted and felt that splenectomy was not 
indicated at this time. They recommend follow up with Dr. ___ 
(___) in 2 months with follow up CT abd/pelvis and 
elective CCY. Because of the patient's prolonged 
hospitalization, ERCP was consulted to evaluate the patient for 
stent removal. A CT pancreatic protocol was performed on ___ 
to evaluate the stent. The stent appeared occluded but due to 
the patient's lack of symptoms and normal LFTs, it was decided 
to defer stent removal and have the patient see ERCP in clinic 
in 1 month. He will need to see both ERCP and Dr. ___ in 
approximately 4 weeks time.    

# Acute kidney injury - Prerenal versus contrast induced 
nephropathy from multiple CT scans. Resolved with IV fluids.

# Type 2 diabetes - Pt was taking Januvia at home but this was 
stopped in the setting of acute pancreatitis. Hyperglycemia was 
attributed to pancreatitis. The patient was started on a humalog 
sliding scale and lantus, which was uptitrated throughout his 
hospital course as needed (with fluctuation in his po intake and 
tube feeds). On discharge, his lantus dose was 40 units at 
dinner time. This should continue to be titrated based on 
fasting AM and QACHS fingersticks.

# Thrombocytopenia - Platelets remained in the low 100s 
throughout hospitalization. Presentation not c/w HIT. Heparin 
therapy was continued. Attributed to splenomegaly.

# Frequent falls - Pt unstable and with psychiatric limitations. 
He had multiple falls in the hospital despite strict fall 
precautions. He complained of right sided rib pain on one 
occasion, for which an XR was performed, showing no fracture. He 
was given 600mg ibuprofen, tylenol, and lidocaine patch with 
good effect. No pain on discharge.

indicative of a moderate to severe diffuse encephalopathy which 
implies
widespread cerebral dysfunction but is non-specific as to 
etiology. No focal
or epileptiform features were noted at any time. Episodes of 
repeated mouth
and tongue movements seen on video were not associated with any 
change on EEG.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
==========================================
___ with a PMHx of COPD, cutaneous TCL, rectosigmoid 
adenocarcinoma (sp radiation and chemotherapy), h/o PE, chronic 
osteomyelitis, alcoholic neuropathy, hypospadia (cb urethral 
stricture with chronic foley), recent hospitalization at ___ 
for Cardiac arrest, recent ESBL UTI, who presented with altered 
mental status from nursing home, was intubated for hypercarbia 
respiratory failure ___ PNA) and transferred to ICU for pressor 
support given hypotension who was successfully extubated and 
weaned off of pressors, who was transferred out of the MICU on 
___, who was s/p 10d course of Zosyn, w/ improved O2 saturations 
via nasal cannula, but profound deconditioning ___ 
hospitalization

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==========================================
#Septic Shock:
On admission lactate elevated and pt was hypotensive, but 
responsive to levophed. Intubation appeared to have precipitated 
hypotension, possibly ___ setting of pHTN (suggested on CTA). 
Cardiogenic shock was also on the differential given question of 
ischemic changes on EKG. Trops however were stable at ~0.04 and 
CK-MB remained flat. Neurogenic shock unlikely despite initial 
question of seizures given no seizure activity on EEG and no 
acute process on CT head. Patient was fluid resuscitated and 
treated with antibiotics allowing him to clinically improve and 
be weaned from pressors. 

# Respiratory Failure/PNA:
Pt presented with hypoxemic, hypercarbic respiratory failure. No 
evidence of PE on CTA; ACS ruled out. Lung process thought 
likely septic pneumonia complicated by COPD, although no 
evidence of COPD exacerbation on vent (see below). CT chest 
revealed near-complete collapse of entire right lung secondary 
to mucus plugging of the R mainstem bronchus, as well as 
enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with pHTN, pointing to 
other contributors to respiratory failure. On follow-up 
bronchoscopy, copius purulent secretions were suctioned from the 
R lung; Multi lobar collapse possibly secondary to severe PNA 
vs. malignancy (there is a note of RUL lung mass ___ record). Pt 
was started on vancomycin/zosyn/azithromycin. Sputum cultures X2 
grew klebsiella sensitive to zosyn and MRSA screen was negative 
therefor pt was narrowed to zosyn monotherapy. Pt was maintained 
on the vent and treated with nebulizers, and initially failed to 
improve: he was difficult to sedate, becoming alternatively 
apneic and unresponsive and agitated on fent/versed. On ___ he 
self-extubated but immediately became hypopneic and sedated and 
required ventilatory support with a bag-valve mask until he 
could be reintubated. Gradually his respiratory status improved, 
and by ___ he was weaned to pressure support. Discussions had 
been underway regarding trach, which patient had undergone ___ 
the past. The decision was made that since he was on minimal 
vent settings, he would be given a trial of extubation, but 
given his volatile respiratory status the team would be ready to 
reintubate quickly if extubation was unsuccessful, with a plan 
for trach/peg the following day. Pt was extubated successfully 
on ___, with no respiratory decompensation. By ___ he was alert 
and oriented, breathing comfortably, and was transferred to the 
floor. Thereafter, he maintained O2 saturations via nasal 
cannula, while finishing course of IV ABX for PNA (Klebsiella 
sensitive to Zosyn). Pt finished 10 day course of Zosyn on ___. 
CXR on ___ showed no interval improvement since ___, w/ 
unchanged RLL opacification. ___ speaking w/ pulm consult 
service, it was thought that pt would likely need time to 
recover fxn of that lobe. Accordingly, he was given outpatient 
pulmonary f/u appt to have such issue re-addressed, as well as 
pHTN evaluated, and lung nodule re-imaged. 

# AMS/Delerium:
On admission, pt presented ___ acute confusional state, thought 
likely to be ___ toxic metabolic encephalopathy. No evidence of 
seizure on EEG. CT head and MRA head both without acute 
processes. Pt was intermittently agitated and nearly-obtunded on 
sedation for ventilation, and was started on seroquel QHS. He 
was successfully extubated on ___, and became alert and oriented 
within 24 hours. He remained AOx3 thereafter without incident. 

# Hyperkalemia:
Pt presented with a K+ of 7.7, not hemolyzed. He had presented 
on multiple prior occasions with hyperkalemia of unclear 
etiology. Differential included RTA vs. ___. No e/o rhabdo, CK 
normal. No peaked Ts on EKG. Pt given kayexelate, Insulin+D5W, 
and his K resolved and remained stable thereafter. 

# ST Depressions: 
On admission, pt had ST depressions on EKG ___ V1-V3 concerning 
for ischemia; no prior EKG available for comparison. However his 
trop and ___ remained flat. TTE showed EF >50%, severe 
pulmonary hypertension but no evidence of focal wall motion 
abnormality or systolic dysfunction. 

# COPD: 
Status of pt's COPD not clear. No evidence of exacerbation at 
present. Low auto-PEEP and nearly normal peak pressures on vent. 
Investigation into OSH records revealed pt does not have a 
pulmonologist and appears not to have undergone pulmonary 
function testing; COPD was a presumed diagnosis given difficulty 
weaning from vent ___ the past. Pt was continued on 
tiotropium/albuterol nebs; however steroids for COPD 
exacerbation were not initiated. Prior to discharge, pt was 
restarted on outpatient regimen of Advair and Tiotropium. Since 
Ipratropium seemed to be a redundant medication, it was 
discontinued on discharge. Pt was given outpatient pulmonary f/u 
appt to have PFTs done, regimen evaluated, pHTN evaluated, and 
lung nodule re-imaged. 

#Pulmonary HTN:
Given findings on TTE and CTA, severe pHTN was thought to 
represent the patient's primary chronic respiratory issue rather 
than COPD. Etiology of pHTN likely chronic OSA given pt's 
habitus. Thus, it was felt that pt could benefit from and R 
heart catheterization ___ future. Accordingly, he was provided 
with a pulmonary f/u appt where such test can be scheduled. 

#Guiac +, Maroon Streaked Stool
___ the ICU, pt was noted to have guiac positive stool, not on 
anticoagulation, but Hct remained stable throughout. On 
admission to the medicine floor, nurses noted that pt had maroon 
colored blood swirled into soft brown stool. Pt had hx of 
rectosigmoid ca s/p XRT/Chemo so could possible represent 
anastamotic issues, radiation proctitis, recurrent malignancy or 
more likely gastritis, or gastric ulcer from critical illness 
and intubation. Pt was without elevated coags or abnormalities 
___ platelets. His Hct was trended and remained stable. He was 
continued on a PPI and did not require blood transfusions. 
However, he will need outpatient gastroenterology follow up to 
have colonoscopy/endoscopy evaluation. 

# Hypothyroidsim:
Levothyroxine continued. 

# ___ on CKD:
Cr baseline is 1.4, of unknown etiology. Increased to max of 2.3 
on ___, likely ___ aggressive diuresis given elevated bicarb and 
dry MM on exam. Pt given 250cc boluses, and lasix held 
thereafter, causing Cr to downtrend to baseline prior to 
discharge.  

# HTN:
Pt hypotensive on arrival, antihypertensives held. Occasionally 
would become hypertensive to 160s when agitated on the vent, but 
required no interventions. By time of discharge, pt was 
restarted on home dose metoprolol XL. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===============================================
1. Pt was given outpatient pulmonary f/u appt to have PFTs done, 
COPD regimen evaluated, pHTN evaluated, lung nodule re-imaged, 
and for discussion of possible therapy w/ intention to re-expand 
chronically collapsed right lower lobe of lung
2. Pt had a R lung nodule identified w/ mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy on CT scan and it is recommended that he have 
repeat CT Chest as outpatient after pneumonia clears to better 
characterize lesion.
3. Pt needs outpatient follow up with Urology for hypospadia
4. Pt should follow up with ___ provider for general 
health care maintenance
5. Pt would benefit from continued physical/occupational therapy 
to recover from profound deconditioning
6. Pt was found to have Guiac positive stool, thought to be ___ 
gastritis, but will need to be evaluated as an outpatient by 
gastroenterologist with endoscopy and colonoscopy.
7. Pt may benefit from speech and swallow re-evaluation

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. 

You were transferred with a tumor compressing your bronchi 
(smaller airways) leading to difficulty breathing. The 
interventional pulmonology team took you to the operating room 
on ___ to remove some of your tumor and place stents in 
your airways. After the surgery, your breathing improved. 

You also have experienced episodes of chest pain, that was 
reproducible with pressing on your chest. Some of the chest pain 
can occur following your surgery. An electrocardiogram looking 
at your heart and lab tests sent were normal. We are reassured 
that there are no acute issues with your heart that need 
immediate interventions.

Finally, you were experiencing episodes of tachycardia, with 
fast heart beats. The EKGs we captured of your heart were 
normal, and the episodes of tachycardia seems to have decreased 
following management of your post-surgical pain. We recommend 
following up with your primary care physician about further work 
up.  

Please continue using the Acapella flutter valve twice a day to 
help loosen the secretions in your air ways, which will help 
prevent pneumonia. 

Please seek immediate care if you experience fevers, chills, 
chest pain, difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, or any 
other concerning symptoms. 

We wish you the best in your health!

Your ___ care team

IMAGING
=======
___: CT CHEST WTIHOUT CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:  
Overall similar appearance of the large posterior mediastinal 
mass resulting in esophageal obstruction, as well as invasion of 
the carina and bilateral mainstem bronchi. There is 
approximately 50% narrowing of bilateral main stem bronchi 
proximal to the endobronchial stents. 
  
Interval increase in the left lower lobe bronchial obstruction, 
with 
associated worsening left lower lobe consolidation and 
atelectasis. 

___: CHEST PORTABLE (AP)
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the scout radiograph of the CT examination 
dated ___, there is again bilateral hilar prominence 
consistent with invasion of the carina and mainstem bronchi from 
a large posterior mediastinal mass.  The bronchial stents are 
not definitely appreciated on the current study. 
Increased opacification at the lung left base was shown to 
represent a combination of lower lobe atelectasis and 
consolidation. 

___: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:  
Comparison to ___, 05:05.  The right paramediastinal 
mass appears 
slightly larger than on the previous examination.  Moreover, 
there is a new opacity projecting over the aortopulmonary 
window.  Lung volumes have 
decreased.  The newly placed endobronchial stent is not directly 
visualized.

___: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:  
As compared to the previous image from ___, 22:22, the 
paramediastinal and perihilar opacities have improved and the 
lung has 
increased in transparent see.  Also improved is a retrocardiac 
atelectasis.  
The tracheal stent is not directly visualized.  Borderline size 
of the heart.  
No pneumothorax.

___: CHEST PORTABLE
Comparison to ___.  Status post esophageal stent 
placement.  The 
paramediastinal opacity on the right is stable.  Mild elevation 
of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  There currently is no 
evidence for the presence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.  A small 
retrocardiac atelectasis is stable in extent and severity. 

___. New ground-glass opacity of the right upper lobe and 
increased 
peribronchiolar nodularity at the right lung base, compatible 
with sequela of aspiration and/or hemorrhage after bronchoscopy. 
 Improvement of left lower lobe consolidation. 
2. Unchanged posterior mediastinal mass, now with patent airways 
after 
tracheal stenting.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
====================================================
___ y/o female with history of recent (___) diagnosis of 
adenocarcinoma of the lung now s/p bronchial stenting (at ___ 
___, depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, and sciatica. She 
was initially seen at ___ where she has been seeing 
Dr. ___ and Dr. ___ with plan for 
initiation of palliative chemo and radiation. She was admitted 
for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and was found to have 
increased bronchus narrowing due to increased size of mass. She 
was transferred to ___ for stenting. She underwent tracheal 
(___) and esophageal (___) stent placements. She requests 
transfer back to ___ for urgent initiation of 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================================================
#) Hypoxemia Secondary to Lung Adenocarcinoma and 
Post-Obstructive Pneumonia: 
- s/p tracheal Y stenting ___ with improvement in symptoms. 
However, developed recurrent SOB requiring another bronchoscopy 
on ___ showing occlusion requiring re-stenting. Following this, 
she had stabilization of dyspnea and hypoxia (on room air at 
discharge)
- continued on Vanc/MTZ for concern of post-obstructive PNA. 
MRSA isolated from bronchial washings. Continue a 10 day course 
(___)

#) Non-small cell lung cancer: Recent diagnosis with mapping and 
plan for palliative chemo and radiation at ___. She 
was evaluated by Heme Onc and ___ Onc at ___, who recommended 
initiation of therapy as soon as possible given rapid growth and 
obstructive complications. Therapy was offered here at ___, 
but patient prefers transfer back to ___, so that 
her sister/HCP can have ease of travel. She is followed by Dr. 
___ (Radiation Oncologist) and Dr. ___ 
(Oncology) at ___. She was maintained on a diluadid 
PCA for pain control.

#) Dysphagia: She has dysphagia secondary to esophageal 
compression by mass. She was seen by the ERCP team at ___ and 
underwent esophageal stent placement on ___ with improvement in 
symptoms. She was started on BID PPI due to pain related to the 
stent. She should continue on a dysphagia soft diet due to her 
stent.

#) Tachycardia: Patient was noted to have episodes of 
tachycardia with bigeminy/trigeminy vs Afib that was 
asymptomatic. Blood pressures stable during periods of 
tachycardia. Likely secondary to mediastinal mass burden. 
- started on low dose metoprolol which will likely need to be 
titrated up.
 
#) Oral candidiasis: Patient was started on nystatin (day 1: 
___

CHRONIC ISSUES:
====================================================
#) Depression/Anxiety/Fibromyalgia: She was continued on her 
home alprazolam, buspirone, and escitalopram.

CT Head: No acute intracranial process with small left subgaleal 
hematoma.

CT Cspine: 
1.  Comminuted fracture of the left facet of the C6 vertebral 
body with 
extension into the lamina, pedicle and posterosuperior 
left-sided aspect of the C6 vertebral body. 
2.  Right-sided C6 pedicular fracture extending into the facet 
and right 
lateral C6 vertebral body. 
3.  Assessment of fracture extension into the transverse 
foramina is limited and as a result cannot fully be excluded.  
Thus, need for CTA to assess vertebral arteries is unclear.  
These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 01:40.  
Initial findings were also discussed with Dr. ___ 
at 23:45 on ___. 
 
CT Sinus: Limited study due to motion without evidence of 
fracture.

CT Torso:
1.  Subcapsular hepatic hematoma with 1 or 2 segment VI, 4-5 cm 
lacerations, though others may be masked due to fatty liver and 
bolus timing 
2.  3.2 cm right adrenal hematoma and stranding about the left 
adrenal gland. 
3.  Stranding and free fluid in the mesentery as well as 
dependently in the pelvis suspicious for mesenteric and/or bowel 
injury, though no additional CT signs of bowel injury are 
identified. 
4.  Non-specific stranding about the aorta and IVC without 
evidence of frank extravasation. 
5.  Right sixth and seventh lateral rib fractures, right fifth 
rib anterior chondral fracture, left fifth through eighth 
anterolateral costochondral fracture-dislocations, and 
transverse process fractures at T6 and T12 through L5 as 
described above. 
6.  No evidence pulmonary contusion with atelectasis felt more 
likely.   
7.  Right axillary soft tissue contusion. 

MRI Cspine:
1. Mild STIR hyperintensity in bilateral C6 pedicles and facets. 
There is 
mal-alignment of bilateral C5-C6 facet joints, left more than 
right which is likely secondary to rotatory subluxation. The 
fractures of C6 facets are better seen on the CT cervical spine. 
No evidence of ligamentous injury. Increased mobility at this 
level can be assessed by flexion/extension views when patient is 
stable if clinically indicated. 
2. A T1 and T2 hypointense soft tissue in the anterior epidural 
space 
extending from C6-C7 disc posterior to C7 body. This likely 
represents an 
extruded disc with inferior migration. This causes deformity of 
the ventral surface of the spinal cord. 
3. No focal signal abnormality in the spinal cord.  
4. Degenerative changes in the cervical spine with multilevel 
neural foraminal stenosis. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the trauma ICU on ___ with the 
following injuries:
Bilateral pulmonary contusions
Right rib fractures ___
Left rib fractures ___
Fracture of C-spine at C6
Transverse process fracture T12-L5
Subcapsular liver hematoma
Segment 6 liver laceration (4cm)
Ileal mesenteric tear with small bowel ischemia
Blunt cardiac injury
Adrenal hematoma

In brief, he was taken to the operating room on admission from 
the ED.  There was a large mesenteric tear and associated small 
bowel ischemia.  This was resected; he had a ileo cecectomy with 
primary anastomosis.  He also was noted to have a liver 
laceration with associated liver ischemia, this was debrided.  
Post-op he was monitored in the ICU and was noted to be 
persistently tachycardic with an increasing pressor requirement. 
His lactate was elevated and rising and he was taken back to the 
OR for a ___ look laparotomy, also on ___.  Approximately 1 
liter of blood was found and an internal hernia. He was 
hemostatic at the end of the case and he was returned to the 
ICU.  The rest of his hospital course by systems below, but in 
brief was characterized by a prolonged wean from the ventilator, 
finally extubated on ___ and liver necrosis and eventual 
fluid collection which was drained by ___. His course is 
described below by system:

Neuro:  He was initially sedated while intubated with a 
combination of propofol, fentanyl and versed but this was weaned 
as appropriate and after extubation he was treated with Dilaudid 
for pain. Orthopedic Spine evaluation was requested for the 
cervical spine fracture- this was treated non operatively with a 
cervical collar. He will follow up in approx 4 weeks with Dr. 
___ have repeat spine films done. He was alert 
and oriented x 3 and neurologically intact with some bilateral 
upper extremity weakness that had improved during his admission.

Cardiac: Patient was hypotensive during the initial days postop 
and required pressors. He was weaned off Levophed on POD#3. Echo 
was performed to evaluate for blunt cardiac injury and the heart 
appeared hyperdynamic with no wall motion abnormalities. Patient 
was resuscitated with PRBC and albumin.  He remained 
hemodynamically stable throughout the rest of his hospital 
course. 

Resp:  He was intubated initially on scene then remained 
intubated post-operatively through two trips to the OR.  
Initially requiring high PEEPs this was eventually weaned though 
he continued to struggle with poor oxygenation and inability to 
wean from the vent, likely due to a combination of pneumonia 
(noted on CXR, BAL after bronch on ___ grew MSSA) and fluid 
overload.  He was placed on a Lasix drip to remove excess fluid 
and treated with levofloxacin (started on ___ for the 
pneumonia; he was eventually weaned to extubation on ___. He 
remained on 40mg PO Lasix daily while on the floor and continued 
to diurese well. He was changed to diamox on ___ to avoid 
hypercarbia. His supplemental oxygen was weaned and his oxygen 
saturation remained stable on room air. Continued pulmonary 
toileting and incentive spirometry were encouraged.  On ___ he 
underwent diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis for 1.5L and 
he symptomatically improved with saturations remaining in the 
mid to high 90's. Follow up CXR showed interval decrease in 
right pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumothorax after 
thoracentesis. 

GI: Patient was taken for emergent laparotomy on the night of 
admission. Postop, patient had persistent lactic acidosis and 
hypotension. Patient was taken back to OR for re-exploration, 
also on ___, as noted above.  He started to spike temperatures 
on ___.  In combination with his downtrending Hct (to 24), 
a CT scan was obtained on ___ it showed a fluid collection 
near a necrotic portion of the liver with fluid in the right 
paracolic gutter.  Hepatobiliary surgery was consulted and 
recommended a triple phase CT to assess progression of the liver 
ischemia/necrosis one week later (this was done on ___ to aid 
in surgical planning regarding debridement.  He was taken by ___ 
on ___ for drainage of the fluid collection near the drain.  
Cultures grew mixed bacteria as well as b. fragilis (he was 
started on Flagyl on ___ along with levofloxacin).

He had a triple phase CT on ___ which demonstrated progression 
of necrosis with expected walling off/organization of the liver 
necrosis.  Also of note on ___, the drainage from his liver 
collection drain (placed ___ by ___ changed from 
serosanguinous/yellow to thicker brown.  There was concern that 
this was stool from a leak in his anastomosis, so he was sent 
down urgently for a CT scan with contrast injected through the 
drain.  The contrast did not enter the bowel which was 
reassuring.  The drainage color change was attributed to 
additional necrosis of the liver which was now sloughing off and 
draining through the drain.

On transfer to the floor on ___ his tube feeds were discontinued 
and he was started on a regular diet. Nutritional supplements 
were added. He tolerated a regular diet and was started on a 
bowel regimen. 

He was discharged to home with the drainage catheter in place, 
teaching was provided to patient and his wife on the ___ and 
monitoring of the drainage catheter system.

GU: On admission, patient was in acute renal failure with 
rhabdomyolysis. He was aggressively hydrated and his creatinine 
improved with downtrend in his CK from 12,0000 to 700 after 
which the level was no longer checked as his urine output was 
excellent and his creatinine normalized.  His urine output was 
normal throughout his stay. On the floor he was diuresed as 
discussed above under respiratory. A Foley catheter remained in 
place for urine output monitoring until ___, at which time it 
was removed and he voided without difficulty. He was noted with 
scrotal edema primarily related to fluid overload; this did 
eventually improve significantly with intermittent diuresis 
using Lasix which was later changed to Diamox.

ID: Patient began to spike fevers on POD#4.  He was started on 
levofloxacin, as noted above, for an MSSA pneumonia and 
completed a 7 day course that was dc'd on ___.  The Flagyl was 
also started on ___ due to the cultures from the drain growing 
bacteroides.  This was continued until ___. At time of 
discharge he was afebrile with a normal white count of 8.2.

MSK: He was evaluated by Physical ad Occupational therapy and at 
time of discharge he was supervision level with the walker.

Dispo: He was discharged home with his wife and was provided 
with follow up appointments with his PCP, ___ surgery and 
Orthopedic Spine.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a motor vehicle crash. 
You sustained multiple injuries including fractures in your 
neck, spine, ribs and an injury to your bowel and liver. You 
required an operation to repair your abdominal injury. You 
required a stay in the intensive ___ unit and were transferred 
to the surgical floor when stable. You are continuing to recover 
well from your accident and are now being discharged home with 
the following instructions:

You should remain in the cervical collar until follow up with 
Orthopedic Spine Surgery. Please follow up with Dr. ___ at 
the appointment scheduled below.

You sustained rib fractures which can cause severe pain and 
subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the 
pain.
You should take your pain medicine as as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.  
If the pain medication is too sedating, take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures. In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake. This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs. 
You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
Do NOT smoke.
Return to the ED right away for any acute shortness of breath, 
increased pain or crackling sensation around your rips 
(crepitus).
Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation. Thefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
If your doctor allows, non steriodal ___ drugs are 
very effective in controlling pain (i.e. Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.

General Drain ___:

*Please look at the site every day for signs of infection 
(increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody 
discharge, warm to touch, fever).

*If the drain is connected to a collection container, please 
note color, consistency, and amount of fluid in the drain. Call 
the doctor if the amount increases significantly or changes in 
character. Be sure to empty the drain frequently. Record the 
output, if instructed to do so.

*Measure and record the output from the ___ catheter every 
day and be sure to bring a log/diary of this information with 
you to your Acute ___ Surgery Clinic follow up.

*Wash the area gently with warm, soapy water.

*Keep the insertion site clean and dry otherwise.

*Avoid swimming, baths, hot tubs; do not submerge yourself in 
water.

*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to 
prevent pulling or dislocation.

feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs. 
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than ___ lbs for ___ weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
 
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want to 
nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. You 
might feel somewhat depressed.
You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. (These are the thin 
paper strips that might be on your incision.) But if they fall 
off before that that's okay.
Your incision may be slightly red around the stitches. This is 
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
It is normal to feel a firm ridge along the incision. This will 
go away.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.

of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving 
the bowels, call your surgeon.
 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is 
getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
You will receive a prescription from your surgeon for pain 
medicine to take by mouth. It is important to take this medicine 
as directied. Do not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do 
not take more medicine at one time than prescribed.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough 
or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the folloiwng, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time

Brief Hospital Course:
___ s/p MVC with multiple injuries including liver lacerations 
with necrotic liver lesion and adjoining collection that has not 
been resolving. He was admitted to the  ___ for further management. IV Unasyn and Flagyl were 
started on ___. He was pan-cultured. CXR demonstrated right 
pleural effusion and air-fluid level ___ the RUQ compatible with 
known right hepatic lobe collection which was stable from 
previous CXR. An abdominal CT scan was done which showed 
no change ___ the size of a large complex hepatic collection with 

unchanged position of pigtail drain. (liver segment VI and VII  
10.1 x 8.0 x 15.0 cm complex collection containing nondependent 
air and complex fluid extending along the inferior edge of the 
liver along the lateral conal fascia with a small drain within 
the fluid collection). Drain outputs averaged 150-190cc/day of 
beige thick drainage. Fluid from this drain were sent to micro. 
Culture isolated pan sensitive Strep anginosus ___. 

On ___, he underwent CT guided exchange over wire of an 8 
___ catheter positioned within the most inferior anterior 
aspect of a right hepatic lobe abscess. A new 8 ___ drainage 
catheter was placed into the more superior portion of the 
hepatic abscess. New drain fluid output was sent for culture. 
Postop procedure he spiked a temperature of 102. IV Vancomycin 
was added to his regimen. Outputs from the new drain averaged 
___ cc/day. Fluconazole was added on ___. 

New drain cultures isolated sparse streptococcus anginosus 
(___).  Anaerobic culture isolated moderate growth of 
Prevotella, beta lactamase negative, and sparse growth 
Bacteroides fragilis, beta lactamase positive.  

The original catheter required repair by radiology  for a 
cracked piece at the adapter. Two days later, the new drain 
(more medial/inferior drain) had dislodged approximately 1.5cm 
necessitating exchange over wire on ___. Vital signs remained 
stable. The drains were flushed with 10ml of saline bid. 

ID was consulted and recommended IV antibiotics for ___ weeks 
for optimal coverage. However, the patient is from N.H. and does 
not have insurance, therefore an oral antibiotic regimen  was 
recommended which consisted of Levaquin 750 mg QD, Flagyl 500 mg 
tid and Fluconazole 400 mg daily for 6 weeks with f/u CT and ID 
follow up.  Scripts for 6 week course of these antibiotics were 
provided. ___ addition, applications for free or reduced drug 
supply from each pharmaceutical company for fluc/Flagyl and Levo 
were completed. He was also given scripts for 5 day supplies for 
antibiotics pending delivery of drugs to Dr. ___ for patient to pick up at f/u visit on ___.

Albumin-2.9* Calcium-8.8 Phos-3.7 Mg-1.___ y/o male admitted for continued medical issues following MVC. 
On admission the patient had an abdominal CT performed showing:
1. No interval change in size of the larger hepatic abscess, 
status post interval removal or dislodgement of a previously 
placed pigtail drain catheter.
2. Pigtail catheter remains in appropriate position in a 
subhepatic collection, which is contiguous with, but possibly 
minimally communicating with, the larger collection. 
3. Slight decrease in size of the loculated right pleural 
effusion with pleural thickening and enhancement. There was 
drainage occuring around the pigtail catheter requiring multiple 
dressing changes daily.
On HD ___ the patient underwent ERCP. Per report, 
cannulation of the biliary duct initially was not possible using 
a free-hand technique. Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was 
successful and deep using a free-hand technique. A ___ 4 cm 
pancreatic duct stent was placed to facilitate cannulation of 
the bile duct. An additional cannulation attempt of the biliary 
duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a 
free-hand technique. Contrast medium was injected resulting in 
complete opacification. Fluoroscopy on the biliary tree showed 
the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left 
hepatic ducts, biliary radicles, cystic duct, and gallbladder 
were filled with contrast and well visualized, and there was no 
evidence of bile leak. A 10cm by ___ Cotton ___ biliary stent 
was placed successfully in the main duct due to the stenotic 
papilla following the sphincterotomy. Also, a nasojejunal 
feeding tube was placed using standard endoscopic nasojejunal 
feeding tube placement rechnique. The ___ tube was 
secured at 120 cm at the nose. 
Immediately following the ERCP, the patient also underwent 
exchange and upsizing to ___ Fr of the existing pigtail in the 
subhepatic fluid collection. The intra-hepatic  collection has 
not had any intervention with this hospitalization.

Initially, the patient was kept NPO overnight per protocol 
following the sphincterotomy, and on the following day, as the 
day progressed, the patient was having increased abdominal and 
back pain, and urine output decreased significantly. A foley was 
placed for monitoring, and he received fluid boluses. A mild 
elevation in the lipase was noted, and temp to 100.5 was noted 
and blood cultures were obtained. 2 days following the ERCP the 
patient had fever to 101.2, and was becoming tachycardic to the 
140's. He was also reporting that the epigastric and back pain 
were worsening.
On ___, due to continued decreased urine output, abdominal pain 
and tachycardia, and fever, the patient was transferred to the 
SICU. He was kept NPO, and was started on TPN folloewing central 
line placement. Lipase peaked at 363 and then started to trend 
down, however his abdominal exam still revealed pain and still 
with significant back pain. The abscess pigtail drain was 
draining 150 - 300 cc daily of purulent appearing, thick light 
tan fluid. Blood cultures have remained negative throughout. 
With resuscitaion and NPO status, the patient's symptoms started 
to improve. Urine output improved, he was afebrile, and so was 
transferred back to the surgical floor. He was continued on TPN.

He received 2 units of RBCs for symptomatic Hct 22.9 with 
appropriate response. 
As symptoms subsided, he was very slowly advanced on his diet, 
and the tube feeds were started via the post pyloric feeding 
tube, which had to be replaced while in the SICU due to 
clogging. On ___ he underwent an abdominal CT, assessing the 
severity of the pancreatitis. There was mild ___ 
stranding and thickening of gerotas fascia. The pigtail catheter 
was still in appropriate position in the subhepatic fluid 
collection. The patient was continued on TPN, and he remained 
NPO. The pigtail drain dressing was noted to have drainage that 
seems to increase when patient upright or ambulating. On ___ he 
was sent to CT for another drain upsize to a ___ Fr drain. At the 
time of the surveillance CT, it was noted that there is oral 
contrast from the previous CT scan layering in the abscess 
cavity, suggestive of a fistulous tract to the bowel. He 
underwent a fluoro study with Optiray injected through the new 
___ catheter. This sjowed the abscess cavity filling and a 
small fistulous communication with what appeared to be the small 
bowel. Upon return to the floor, the drainage has taken on a 
brown and thick appearance. At this time he was made NPO and 
will continue on TPN.

TPN was continued on the surgical floor until ___. Prior to 
discontinuation of the TPN, Mr. ___ received a CT scan with 
injection of contrast through his pigtail catheter to further 
elucidate the anatomy. The plan at that time was operative 
intervention assuming the fistula was still patent. However, the 
CT did not identify fistula. Per report, the following was 
identified: ""Opacification of the right perihepatic and 
paracolic gutter abscess cavity without evidence of small bowel 
fistulous communication on CT."" Operative intervention was 
therefore withheld. Mr. ___ completed a few more days of TPN, 
and then was transitioned to an oral diet. After several days of 
increasing PO intake, he was consuming approximately 1800 kcal 
per day. He was safely discharged on ___ with PTBD 
in place and planned follow-up in clinic.

Abdominal abscess pigtail drain ___

 
History of Present Illness:
___ who was involved ___ a MVC requiring ex-lap,
ileocecectomy c/b hemoperitoneum requiring takeback < 24 hours.
Eventually this patient presented with a suspect enteric fistula
and liver abscess which then the transplant surgical service did
an ex-lap, drainage of abscess and ileocolectomy with 
ileocolonic
anastamosis. During this last hospitalization, his abscess was
polymicrobial and recieved V/C/F. Eventually his antibiotics 
were
switched over to Augmentin on discharge. 

He was last seen approximately on ___ at which time a CT 
of
the abdomen revealed a marked improvement ___ the abscess cavity
with a residual fluid collection measuring 6.7 x 3.5 cm. His
last remaining drain was removed at that time as it was only
putting out 5 cc/day of serous fluid. Per ID, given the
persistance of this collection, the decision was to continue
augmentin for 2 more weeks, which it appears the patient did not
do. 

Was doing well since then. No complaints. Good PO intake. 2 days
ago developed abdominal pain, felt a ""mass"" where previous JP
drain sites were. No N/V, +flatus. This AM developed fever of
101. Took some advil and tylenol and called ___ 
and
was informed to come to ED for further eval. 

Patient currently denies any other symptoms other than RUQ
abdominal pain. Of note patient has been slowly tapering off 
pain
medications since last year.

enteric fistula s/p debridement and ileocolectomy. Patient had 
large fluid collection before drain was pulled presented with 
fevers, elevated LFT and new onset abdominal pain near fluid 
collection,  worrisome for infected fluid collection and/or new 
liver abscess. Other ddx included cholecystitis and abscess near 
ileocolonic anastamosis. He was pan cultured and started on IV 
Vanco, Cipro and Flagyl. CT Abd/Pelvis with PO and IV contrast 
was done showing 7.5 x 3.5 x 13.3 cm (TV x AP x CC) subhepatic 
collection extending up to the anterolateral abdominal wall ___ 
the region of the prior drain. The previous perihepatic 
collection located more posteriorly was nearly resolved with a 
small amount of residual fluid remaining. On ___ he had a 
temperature spike to 102. He then underwent CT-guided placement 
of an 8 ___ catheter inside right mid abdomen abscess.  There 
was no communication of the adjacent bowel was demonstrated.  
Drainage was from collection was sent to microbiology. Drain 
output was purulent. 

He remained afebrile with wbc decreasing to 5.5 from 12. Drain 
output averaged 40cc/d then decreased to 20cc/d. Drain was 
flushed with saline and flush came out of drain insertion site. 
Drain output decreased to scant output. Micro isolated 
pansensitive Citrobacter and E. coli. ID was consulted and 
recommended oral Cipro 500mg bid and Flagyl 500mg tid for 2 
weeks then f/u CT. 

Instructions for drain care were provided. Drain flushes were 
stopped. He felt well and was discharged to home.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male admitted to Dr. ___ service with abdominal 
pain. An abdominal CT was done demonstrating recurrent RLQ 
abscess near colonic anastomosis concening for fistula. 
Recurrent air and fluid collection was seen where a pigtail 
catheter was previously, just deep to the peritoneum, with a 
tract extending through the right-sided abdominal wall 
musculature into the subcutaneous fat. This collection was 
adjacent to the ileocecal anastomosis. No enteric contrast 
within the collection to indicate leak at the anastomosis. He 
underwent placement of an 8 ___ drain into the right 
abdominal abscess with removal of 40cc purulence. Drainage was 
sent to micro. Vanco and Zosyn were started after drainage of 
the abscess. ID was consulted. Micro isolated Citrobacter 
sensitive to cipro, 3 colonies of Strep veridans and coag 
negative staph. ID recommended Levaquin 500 mg daily and Flagyl 
m500 mg TID until f/u drain study ___ 3 weeks. 

WBC decreased to 6.4 from 13. He remained afebrile and drain 
output initially was 40cc. This further decreased to 25cc. 
Patient will flush at home and continue antibiotics.

mechanical fall.

#HEAD TRAUMA/INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGES
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Neurosurgical ICU for Q1 hour 
neurochecks after having subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages 
in his brain after mechanial fall.  Aspirin was held due to his 
head injury.  He was started on Keppra 500mg BID for seizure 
prophylaxis given his extensive head injury.  His neuroligical 
exam fluctuated likely due to his head injury with underlying 
cognitive slowing.
On the morning of ___emonstrated stable 
bilateral SAH and contusions and he was transfered to the 
regular floor.  He was unable to tolerate PO foods or pills so 
an NG tube was placed. Speech and Swallow consult was obtained 
and he was not able to control his secretions. On ___, a repeat 
head CT was stable. At time of discharge, patient was still not 
able to control oral secretions (failed speech and swallow the 
day of discharge) and thus needed continued feeds through ___ 
gastric tube, a new ___ tube was placed post-pyloric 
per ___ on ___.

# UPPER RESPIRATORY SECRETIONS/COUGH: Pt had some upper airway 
crackles on exam. Serial CXRs were negative for pneumonia. Upper 
airway crackles likely secondary to patient's poor ability to 
control oral secretions. He was satting in high ___ on RA.

# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The patient had a persistently altered 
mental status and was frequently A&Ox0. He was inattentive, and 
clutched at gown and lines, and required soft restraints (mitts) 
for several days to prevent injury to self. Mental status waxed 
and waned daily; pt was occasionally able to engage in simple 
conversation answering with 1 word. These deficits were likely 
due primarily to recent head trauma, baseline deficits, and 
delirium. ___ EEG indicated mild diffuse encephalopathy. The 
patient was maintained on his home regimen of Aricept, Zoloft, 
and mirtazapine. 

# Right upper extremity FRACTURE: The pt had marked bruising of 
his upper extremities bilaterally, which prompted bilateral 
upper extremity radiographs. Pt was found to have a right radial 
fracture. Cast was placed, per orthopedics.

# THROMBOCYTOPENIA  On admission, pt had a mild 
thrombocytopenia, which resolved spontaneously during his 
hospital course.

# RENAL INCIDENTALOMA: On abdominal CT (preparation for ?PEG 
placement), the pt was noted to have an isodense 1.6-cm renal 
lesion. According to readiology, this finding can be better 
evaluated with ultrasound. We did not pursue this finding 
further, given the patient's age, active medical issues and 
comorbidities, and absence of renal/urologic symptoms. Can be 
further addressed outpatient.

# ELEVATED CREATININE/Chronic Kidney Disease: During his 
admission, the pt's serum creatine ranged from 1.3 to 1.5. 
Baseline Cr unknown. Cr stable the last week of his 
hospitalization. Pt likely has some degree of CKD.

# GOALS OF CARE: Family very actively involved in patient's 
care. Decision was made to make him DNR/DNI, although 
immediately prior to transport to the rehab facility the family 
changed him to DNI but okay to rescucitate. Family is interested 
in pursuing treatments at this time to see if his father's 
mental status can be optimized (ex: physical therapy, ___ 
gastric feeding). If he does not clinically improve over the 
next ___ weeks, family has expressed interest in discussing 
changing goals of care to focusing on comfort. These wishes are 
consistent with patient's living will.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a privilege to participate in your care.

You were admitted to the ___ 
___ you had fallen and hit your head, and were found to have 
bleeding in your brain. You were admitted to the Neurosurgery 
Service, where you were observed for several days. A tube was 
put through your nose, into your stomach, so that you could 
receive nutrients and medicines.
After several days, you were transferred to the General Medicine 
Service, because of concerns about your breathing. 

You were observed on the Medicine service for several days. You 
did not have a lung infection (pneumonia), but you did have a 
cough related to mucus and extra saliva in your throat. Because 
you were unable to control your swallowing muscles, you 
continued to be fed by a tube in your nose. 

The Medicine Service discovered a fracture (""broken bone"") in 
your right wrist. This fracture probably occurred during your 
recent fall. The Orthopedic Surgery service recommended that 
your right arm be put in a cast. 

Finally, you were often confused during your time on our 
service. Often, you did not know your name or where you were. We 
hope that this will improve, along with your physical health, in 
the Rehabilitation Hospital. 

Neurosurgery provided the following recommendations:

-  You must stop drinking alcohol
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, 
or excessive bending.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any 
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, or 
Ibuprofen etc. 

CALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE 
FOLLOWING

New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status. 
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not 
relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on 
one whole side of your body.

___ Complaint:
Chief Complaint: tachycardia, hypertension, nausea, tremors
Reason for MICU transfer: uremia and hyperkalemia needing urgent 
HD 

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ M with h/o ESRD on Mo/Th HD and HTN 
who presents with confusion, shakiness and hypertension in 
setting of missing HD two days ago, found to be uremic with 
hyperkalemia on labs and admitted to ICU for urgent HD. 

Pt normally receives dialysis twice weekly on ___ and 
___. This ___ he reports he missed dialysis because he 
""just forgot"". After this, he was noted to become more confused 
at his assisted living facility. He does remember this but 
doesn't recall many details of past few days. He denies any 
other symptoms like fever, chills, cough, dysuria, 
nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation. Today at his assisted 
living facility he was found to be confused and shaky/tremulous, 
hypertensive and complaining of nausea. He was sent to ED for 
evaluation. 

Of note, pt recently presented to ___ ED on ___ from his 
facility for similar symptoms of confusion, hypertension and 
shaking after awaking from a nap. Had received dialysis earlier 
in the day during which he complained of nausea and was 
tachycardic. Labs at that time showed K 4.6, BUN 49, Cr 7.7 
NCHCT showed extensive white matter hypodensities which may be 
due to chronic small vessel disease and lacunar infarcts, but 
also consider multi-infarct dementia in appropriate clinical 
setting. Plan was for further toxic-metabolic workup of his 
confusion, but pt refused further care. Psychiatry was consulted 
and noted impaired word-list recall but overall felt he had 
capacity to make decision to leave ED.  

In the ED, initial vitals: 99.8 110 178/85 18 93% 2L NC. On exam 
had bibasilar crackles, tremors, asterixis and was oriented x1 
only. Labs notable for K 7.4, HCO3 18, BUN 107, Cr 15.0, AG 29. 
WBC 13.9 (85.7% PMNs). EKG showed mildly peaked T waves, <1mm ST 
depressions in lateral leads. CXR showed cardiomegaly, no 
pulmonary edema. Pt received calcium gluconate, insulin + 
dextrose, albuterol and kayexelate. Potassium downtrended from 
7.4 to 6.1 in the ED. Was seen by nephrology who recommended 
urgent dialysis against low-K bath, likely to be repeated in 
late morning or afternoon. He was admitted to the ICU for urgent 
HD and lab monitoring. He became agitated, refused care and 
attempted to leave ED, security was called and pt deemed unable 
to leave given acutely altered mental status, no capacity to 
refuse care. Received Diazepam 10mg PO once. On transfer, vitals 
were:  98.9 77 168/74 20 100% RA.  

On arrival to the MICU, vitals are 88, 171/92, 99% RA. Patient 
had large liquid bowel movement on arrival. He is currently 
asymptomatic. 

Review of systems: positive per HPI, otherwise negative.

MICROBIOLOGY: 
- Hepatitis serologies (___): ***

EKG (___): Sinus rhythm with borderline first degree A-V 
conduction delay. Non-specific intraventricular conduction 
delay. Poor R wave progression. Peaked T waves in leads V2-V3 
could be due to hyperkalemia. Prolonged QTc interval. Compared 
to the previous tracing of ___ the precordial T waves are 
taller and more peaked and the QTc interval is slightly longer 
and the P-R interval is longer which all could be consistent 
with hyperkalemia. The lateral ST-T wave abnormalities in leads 
V4-V6 are less pronounced. 

AP CXR (___): 
1. Mild cardiomegaly with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 
2. 15-mm nodular opacity superior to the right costophrenic 
angle, possibly a calcified pulmonary nodule. Further assessment 
with conventional radiographs should be performed once the 
patient's fluid status has normalized. 
3. Bulbous appearance of the right hilus should be reassessed on 
the same 
conventional radiographs as recommended in impression point #2. 

PA/LAT CXR (___): ***
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ M with h/o ESRD on Mo/Th HD and HTN 
who presents with confusion, shakiness and hypertension in 
setting of missing HD two days ago, found to be uremic with 
hyperkalemia on labs and admitted to ICU for urgent HD. 

# UREMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: Presented with confusion, shakiness and 
hypertension in setting of missing HD two days PTA. Exam notable 
for confusion and asterixis which cleared with hemodialysis. His 
encephalopathy was likely due to uremia from missing dialysis. 
This is also likely acute on chronic picture, as prior head CT 
showed significant small vessel disease and lacunar strokes 
which suggest probable underlying vascular dementia. He has 
history of EtOH abuse but insists he has been sober for one 
year. His mental status improved back to baseline with 
hemodialysis. 

# UREMIA, HYPERKALEMIA: Pt has ESRD on bi-weekly dialysis. He 
skipped his ___ HD session and thus presented with uremia 
with anion gap acidosis and hyperkalemia to 7.6 with peaked T 
waves. His hyperkalemia improved with medications in the ED 
(calcium gluconate, insulin, albuterol and kayexelate) and 
subsequent HD. He received urgent HD session on arrival to ICU 
at 4am, and was dialyzed again in the afternoon. Had his routine 
HD session on HD #2 (___) during hospitalization as well. 
His home cinacalcet, calcium carbonate and nephrocaps were 
continued. 

# HYPERTENSION: Arrived hypertensive to SBP 180s. Received 
hydral 10mg x2 and labetalol 50mg x1, then his home nifedipine 
was restarted. With these medications and receipt of HD, his SBP 
improved to 120s. He also had mild pulmonary edema in setting of 
HTN and renal failure on admission. Improved with dialysis and 
home torsemide. 

# POOR MEDICAL COMPLIANCE: Pt has poor insight into his medical 
problems and per his home nurse practitioner, has missed 
multiple dialysis sessions over the past year. He currently 
resides at an assisted living facility but probably needs higher 
level of care (e.g. SNF). Social work and case management were 
involved and counseled patient about this, but he is competent 
to make his own decisions and he refused to go to ___. Will 
receive daily ___ visits at home. 
 
# ?NODULE ON CXR: Chest x-ray showed question of RLL nodular 
opacity. Repeat AP/lateral CXR showed interval resolution of 
this finding, probable engorged vessel.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ M with h/o ESRD on Mo/Th HD and HTN 
who presents with lower GI bleeding with hyperkalemia on labs 
and admitted to ICU for urgent HD. 
.
# Hyperkalemia: Potassium 6.8 with hyperacute T waves on 
admission. Similar presentation on admission ___ after missing 
hemodialysis session. Received insulin, dextrose, calcium 
gluconate in the ED. Improved after urgent HD while in the ICU.
.
# BRBPR: Patient presented with BRBPR with bowel movement after 
episode of abdominal cramping. No evidence of ongoing bleed: 
hemodynamically stable, hematocrit stable. GI evaluated, imaging 
deferred at this time. Ddx includes gastroenteritis, stool 
studies were sent and were pending.  Patient did not have any 
subsequent bloody bowel movements, and GI recommended that the 
patient receive an outpatient colonoscopy.
.
# ESRD on HD: Patient was followed by Nephrology/Dialysis during 
admission.  He should follow up with his nephrologist as an 
outpatient.  Specifically, given his frequency of admission for 
hyperkalemia, he should consider increasing the frequency of his 
HD sessions to 3x/week to prevent such occurrences.
.
# Hypertension: systolic BPs to the 200s on admission to the ICU 
in the setting of missing home BP meds. Restarted on home 
metoprolol, nifedipine, torsemide with good improvement in BP.
.
# POOR MEDICAL COMPLIANCE: Pt has poor insight into his medical 
problems and per his home nurse practitioner, has missed 
multiple dialysis sessions over the past year. He currently 
resides at an assisted living facility but probably needs higher 
level of care (e.g. SNF). Social work and case management were 
involved and counseled patient about this in the past, but he is 
competent to make his own decisions and has refused SNF in the 
past. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
**Please schedule a colonoscopy for patient within the next 
month.
**Please consider retitration of antihypertensives in 
coordination with nephrology.
**F/u with nephrology regarding frequent hospitalizations for 
uremia, consider increasing frequency of HD sessions

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent Coronary artery bypass graft x4:  Left 
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and 
saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, obtuse marginal, and 
posterior descending arteries.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable, but required additional time with 
vasopressor support.  Chest tubes were removed without problems. 
 He developed symptomatic, rapid atrial fibrillation on POD 2 
and converted to sinus rhythm after IV amiodarone and beta 
blocker was initiated.  After receiving 1uRBC for postop anemia, 
he developed flash pulmonary edema and required bipap support.  
He responded will to diuretics and was transitioned to HiFlo 
nasal cannula and eventual traditional nasal cannula oxygen 
support.  His pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication.  Given his ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%), his 
lisinopril was restarted.  Lisinopril was subsequently 
discontinued due to hypotension.   He was transferred to the 
telemetry floor for further recovery.  The patient was evaluated 
by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was 
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled 
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home with 
___ in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

Neuro ICU from ___ on ___ after he was found to
be in status epilepticus.  He has a medical history significant
for HTN, HLD, psoriasis, chronic back pain on home opiates,
question of alcohol abuse, but no prior history of seizures.  
Per
report from his wife, he had been feeling well on ___.  He went
to bed and woke up at 7:30AM complaining of left knee pain while
he was in bed.  He apparently accidentally rolled out of bed by
accident, and when his wife found him on the floor, he had
labored breathing and appeared confused briefly.  Shortly after
this episode he returned to baseline and was able to get back up
into bed, go to the bathroom and prepare a cup of coffee without
further deficit.  Around 9AM, however, he had a subsequent event
while seated in a chair watching TV.  Per report, he shouted the
phrase ""Dont leave"" after which he had a fixed gaze forward that
was associated with whole-body stiffening.  This developed into
bilateral arm shaking with a tongue bite that lasted ___ 
minutes.
His wife called EMS and by the time they arrived, his posture
improved but he was confused and unable to converse.  En route 
to
the hospital, EMTs reported that he had return to baseline 
mental
status.  At ___, however, he had a prolonged witnessed 
GTC
seizure in the ED that was refractory to 6 mg ativan.  It is
unclear how long he seized, but subsequently he was loaded with
dilantin and then intubated/sedated with propafol for seizure
control.   Broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime,
acyclovir) for meningitis coverage were started and NCHCT was
done which showed no abnormality.

By the time he arrived to ___ he had no seizures.   MRI showed
no abnormalities, EEG showed diffuse slowing but no seizures, 
and
LP (0 WBCs) was unremarkable.  Phenytoin trough was found to be
low and a decision was made to transition Dilantin to Keppra
1000mg BID.  He was successfully extubated on ___ and mental
status.  He was placed on CIWA scale ___ for agitation and
tremulousness, though secondary to possible alcohol withdrawal. 
Incidentally he was found to have a humeral fracture which was
repaired by orthopedics on ___.

With respect to seizure history there is no known head trauma. 
No
personal or family history of seizures.   He drinks ___ drinks
per night but reportedly sneaks more alcohol and his daily
alcohol intake may be higher.  He has not had signs of recent
infection. General review of systems prior to this event was
unremarkable

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU COURSE: Admitted ___ for status epilepticus (first 
seizure
at home appeared to be GTC, several seizures at ___
without recovery between); known EtOH history with question of
withdrawal seizures.  EEG without seizure activity ( though 
found with low phenytoin
trough, switched fosphenytoin to Keppra ___. In ICU LP, MRI,
toxic/metabolic work-up unrevealing. Extubated evening of 
___,
scored for CIWA ___ for agitation, tremulousness. Also he 
was incidentally found with LUE humerus fracture went to OR for 
fixation on ___. 

GENERAL NEURO COURSE:
___ p/w status epilepticus stepped down from
Neuro ICU on ___ presumably from ETOH withdrawal.  Workup showed 
normal LP, normal MRI/NCHCT, and unrevealing toxic/metabolic 
work-up.  During his seizures he sustained a left humerus 
fracture and now s/p LUE humerus fracture repair on ___.  Neuro 
exam is non focal. Initially he was scoring >12 on the CIWA 
scale for agitation, tremulousness and hallucinations but this 
imporved substantially by ___ and he required no further prn 
ativan.  No clear provoking metabolic factor for new seizures.  
He admits to 3 drinks of vodka per evening (with some question 
of heavier drinking per wife), he takes a significant number of 
narcotics for his chronic back and knee pain and we suspect that 
alcohol withdrawal and medications may have precipitated the 
event.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ as a 
transfer from ___ on ___ after you had a cluster of 
seizures.  At ___ you were given ativan and 
dilantin and you had to be intubated to control your seizures 
and protect your breathing.   A CT scan showed that you had no 
stroke or lesion to account for seizures.  At ___ MRI 
showed no abnormalities, EEG showed no seizures, and lumbar 
puncture showed no signs of infection.  We changed your 
antiseizure medication to KEPPRA 1000mg twice daily and you were 
successfully extubated on ___.  During your seizure, you 
fractured your left arm and that was repaired by orthopedics on 
___.  After the surgery you had agitation and tremulousness 
that was concerning for alcohol withdrawal.  For severe symptoms 
we gave you ativan as needed, but you improved greatly by ___.  
Our physical therapists felt you were appropriate to be 
discharged to home with home ___ and a cane.  

There was no abnormality with your brain or infection to explain 
why you had a seizure.  Given your tremulousness and agitation, 
we suspect that your seizure may be related to alcohol intake.  
It is very improtant that you make continued efforts to stop 
drinking, as withdrawal from alcohol will put you at risk for 
repeat seizures. Please take the medications listed on this 
summary (KEPPRA/LEVETIRACETAM) and come to the follow-up 
appointments we have arranged.  Thank you for allowing us to 
participate in your care.

You also have a fracture of your left arm as well as 
dislocation. The Orthopedic Surgeons operated and fixed this 
issue. They want you to followup in the Orthopedics Trauma 
Clinic on the ___ of ___ in ___ days from discharge. 
They also want you to follow these instructions:
1. Keep your arm at your side. Do not perform any range of 
motion exercises. Your physical therapists may perform 
""pendulum"" exercises which they will tell you about.
2. You do not need to place a dressing on the surgical wound 
unless there is drainage. If so, you can place a clean gauze 
bandage with medical tape on the surgical wound as needed.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ M presenting w/acute onset of moderate to severe bilateral 
hip and thigh pain 3 weeks ago, symptoms persisted, 
w/exacerbation with ambulation, essentially
pain free at rest, now with increasingly severe symptoms over 
the last 48 hours.  Workup for this pain included a abd CT which 
showed probable focal infrarenal aortic dissection, measuring 
3.4 cm in diameter, which is incompletely evaluated on this 
non-contrast CT.  There is no surrounding stranding to suggest 
evidence of rupture. A CTA of the area showed 3.6 cm focal 
infrarenal aortic dissection with fenestrations and contrast  
entering the false lumen.  There is no evidence of rupture.  The 
age is indeterminate.

He was hypertensive to the 180s so an arterial line was placed 
and a nicardipine infusion was started with goal BP less than 
140. We were able to quickly discontinue the nicardipine and 
transistion him to an oral antihypertensive regiment. 
He remained hemodynamically stable with less pain with 
ambulation, tolerating a regular diet.   He was discharged to 
home in stable condition.  He will followup with his PCP when he 
returns to ___.

Discharge Instructions:
You presented to the ER secondary to moderate to severe 
bilateral hip and thigh pain that worsened with walking.  
Further investigation  with a CT scan showed an aortic 
dissection as the cause of  your pain.  Your blood pressure was 
very high.  We needed to increase the doses of your current 
medications and add a new medication called hydralazine (see 
attached medication list) to control your blood pressure. This 
is the major treatment for your dissection. 

Please follow up with your PCP as soon as possible. We have 
given you a 5 day supply of the new medication.   Your blood 
pressure must be closely monitored with goal BP < 140 systolic.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L2-5 lumbar lami and fusion ___

 
History of Present Illness:
I am seeing Mr. ___ today for another followup.  He finally
agreed to surgery and it is coming up.  New MRI was reviewed. 
Much worse L2-L3 severe stenosis with total occlusion of the
spinal canal.  Unchanged severe L3-L4 stenosis.  His neurogenic
claudication has gotten much worse.  L4-L5, however, seems to be
slightly better and I think we do not need to operate at this
level.  The patient's main symptoms now is inability to stand
straight and he has to walk significantly flexed and then he 
gets
acute shooting pain in the groin every time he stands up.  He is
definitely going to benefit from L2-L4 facetectomies,
laminectomies to decompress the spinal canal and fusion L2-L4. 
We are going to book it for this coming ___ as scheduled.

lumbar-type 
vertebrae.  The patient is status post laminectomy and posterior 
stabilization from L2-L4.  There is a moderate scoliosis convex 
to the right centered at L3. There is preservation of the normal 
lumbar lordosis.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes 
similar in appearance when compared to the prior MRI.  Facet 
joint arthropathy also noted.  A surgical drain appears to be

The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size of the cardiac 
silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.  No pleural 
effusions.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.

___ EKG

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old man with history of lumbar stenosis who 
presents electively today for L2-5 lumbar lami and fusion.A 
hemovac was placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well 
and was recovered in the pacu.  The patient was transferred to 
the floor in stable condition and his diet was advanced.  The 
patient was neurologically intact at the time of the post 
operative check.  

On post operative day one patient was neurologically intact. His 
foley was removed.  He was evaluated by ___ who did TLSO brace 
teaching. He underwent AP and Lateral xrays in his brace which 
revealed good alignment and hardware placement. 

On ___ Patient complained of pain. Worked with physical therapy 
who determined they needed one more visit prior to safe 
discharge. 

On ___, patient was triggered for new onset afib RVR.  Poorly 
responsive to metop and was transferred to the unit.  Stat CTA 
was negative for PE, with no clear infectious cause.  He was 
found to be retaining 700cc urine and foley was placed.  With 
foley placement he subsequently spontaneously converted.  He was 
transferred back to the floor.

On ___, he had several episodes of afib RVR (asymptomatic) for 
which he received metop IV.  Tropoinin were negative and he 
spontaneously converted back to NSR.   He was started on Metop 
12.5 q6hr.  He was transferred to the step down unit. Medicine 
was consulted.  Subsequent echo, u/a and TSH were ordered. 
Patient's heart rate was then elevated and sustained in the 
150s, he was given a total of 15mg of IV lopressor and 10mg IV 
of diltiazem. IV diltiazem had some success with heart rate to 
120s. He very quickly went back up to 150s and was sustained, 
systolic blood pressure was in the ___. He was given a liter 
fluid bolus and started on a diltiazem gtt ___. He was back 
into sinus rhythm with heart rate in the ___. His blood pressure 
was normailized. 

On ___, Mr. ___ heart rate was stable on the diltiazem 
drip and oral formulation of the drug.  The drip was 
successfully discontinued and his heart rate remained stable and 
in sinus rhythm.  He was started on warfarin (with no bridge) 
per Medicine's recommendations.  The patient's bowel regimen was 
changed for more aggressive treatment of his constipation.

On ___, Mr. ___ remained hemodynamically stable.  He moved 
his bowels successfully.  Overall, he felt well and was ready 
for discharge home.

On ___ Patient remained in NSR. HR in the ___. He was 
discharged home with instructions for follow up. He was 
discharged on coumain with instructions to follow up with his 
oupatient cardiologist this ___ for INR monitoring.

Imaging:
___ CXR:
FINDINGS: The lungs are somewhat low ___ volume without focal 
consolidation,
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is stably enlarged 
with 3 lead
pacemaker/defibrillator noted.  No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax is seen. 
Bilateral lateral pleural thickening is noted, unchanged since 
___.
 
IMPRESSION: Unchanged examination without acute intrathoracic 
process.

___ Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely 
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis 
(LVEF = 10 %). The right ventricular free wall thickness is 
normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed 
free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Severe (4+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. ___ the setting of at least 
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There 
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent 
fat pad.

Marked left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony is present. 
However, marked ventricular interaction with reverse Bernheim 
phenomenon is also seen, due to marked right ventricular 
pressure and volume overload.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
both ventricles are even more dilated, and severe mitral and 
tricuspid regurgitation are now present. Mechanical left 
ventricular dyssynchrony remains evident.

___ Right Heart Cath:
COMMENTS:     
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart 
filling
pressures.  The RA mean pressure was 22 mmHg, mean PCW 31 mmHg.  
The
cardiac index calculated using the Fick equation was 1.57 
l/min/m2.
 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. Elevated right and left heart filling pressures.
2. Low cardiac index.

___ 10:17AM Echo:
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is profoundly depressed (LVEF = 10%). Significant left 
ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony is present (posterior wall 
remains the site of latest activation). The right ventricular 
free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is 
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. Moderate (2+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the appearance of mitral and tricuspid 
regurgitation is reduced. Marked left ventricular dyssynchrony 
persists. Right ventricular function appears similar.  

___ 3:34PM Echo:
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 15 
%). [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, the overall left ventricular ejection 
fraction is increased as a result of reduced mechanical 
dyssynchrony  

___ CXR:
CONCLUSION:
1.  There is no pneumothorax.
2.  Right-sided PICC line is still looped inside the subclavian 
vein.
3.  Unchanged bibasilar consolidation.

___ CXR:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the gastric 
distention has decreased.  There is unchanged evidence of low 
lung volumes with areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.  The 
ECG cables, pacemaker wires and right PICC line are constant.  
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  No new parenchymal opacities 
___ the ventilated lung zones.  No pneumothorax.

___ 7:44AM CXR:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no 
relevant
change.  Moderate cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema.  
The areas of
increased density at the right lung base are minimally 
progressive.  No new
parenchymal opacities.  No pneumothorax.

___ 12:59PM CXR:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, there is minimally 
improved
ventilation at both the left and right lung base.  Plate-like 
atelectasis at the level of the left hilus.  Normal size of the 
cardiac silhouette.  No
evidence of pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Course:
___ YOM with history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p Dual 
Chamber ICD presenting with CC of intermittent SOB and 
transferred from OSH out of concern for decompensated CHF.  

Active Issues:
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF: EF 10% on echo ___. RHC 
showing RA mean 22, PA mean 39, PCW mean 39, CO 3.16, CI 1.57, 
suggesting elevated filling pressures and low cardiac output. 
BNP is elevated to ___, no baseline. Exacerbation may be 
secondary to ventricular dyssynchrony since the left ventricular 
lead was shut off after it was noted to cause significant chest 
wall stimulation. Patient was started on a milrinone drip ___ 
conjunction with lasix drip for optimization prior to BiV lead 
manipulation. The patient underwent left thoracotomy with left 
ventricular pacing wire placement on ___. He was 
successfully extubated ___ the OR and transferred to the CVICU 
with a left chest tube ___ place set to suction. Post-op CXR was 
notable for no pneumothorax and a new LV lead. Post-op echo 
notable for no pericardial effusion, improved dyssynchrony, EF 
___ and no intracardiac thrombi. Milrinone and furosemide 
drips were continued post procedure. On the morning for ___ 
the patient became hypotensive with SBPs ___ ___. He was 
administered albumin with a transient increase ___ pressure to 
SBP ___.  Milrinone and furosemide were stopped and 
norepinephrine was started. A stat echocardiogram showed 
significant left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony and dilated 
right ventricular cavity with depressed free wall contractility. 
It was thought that the LV lead was not capturing. 
Norepinephrine was stopped and dopamine started, with an 
increase ___ UOP and improvement ___ blood pressure. The CCU was 
consulted and the patient transferred. CVP prior to transfer was 
12, and SvO2 61%. The patient denied any CP or dyspnea at the 
time of transfer. Repeat CXR showed fluid ___ the right fissure 
but improving atelectasis. Dopamine was discontinued on arrival 
to the CCU per the heart failure team. The patient was 
transiently placed back on milrinone and furosemide drips which 
were discontinued and replaced by dobutamine and norepinephrine. 
He was diuresed with intermittent boluses of furosemide, 
furosemide drip and metolazone for a goal CVP ___. SBPs of 
80-90s were tolerated. The patient required low dose 
norepinephrine for pressure support during diuresis. The chest 
tube was pulled by cardiac surgery on ___. Pt was started 
on torsemide 60mg BID on ___ which was decreased to 
torsemide 40mg daily on ___ when the patient was clinically 
euvolemic. He was also started on isosorbide dinitrate and low 
dose metoprolol. His isosorbide dinitrate was converted to 
mononitrate prior to discharge.

# Acute on CKD: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2. Creatinine trended up 
and peaked at 2.9, likely from cardio-renal syndrome. Creatinine 
improved with milrinone and diuresis.

# Hyponatremia: Likely due to appropriate ADH secretion ___ 
setting of cardiorenal syndrome given high urine Na and 
improvement with fluid restriction.
 
# Leukocytosis: No infectious symptoms. Urine culture negative.

# Anxiety: Hyperventilates when upset, responds well to calming. 
Continued on alprazolam.
  
Inactive Issues:
# Paranoid schizophrenia: Continued on olanzapine.  

# Right middle lobe atelectasis: Seen on CXR from ___, but now 
appears denser. Radiology recommends follow up CT to rule out 
post-obstuctive atelectasis.

Transitional Issues:
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF: patient started on metorpolol, 
spironolactone, isosorbide, torsemide and should be followed for 
response to therapy, side effects.

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o M with nonischemic dilated CMY, EF ___ attributed to  
an anti-psychotic medication, mild pHTN, ___ MR and TR, CKD b/l 
___ creatinine, with BiV ICD presents for decreased appetite, 
orthopnea, has to stop when walks from garage to his house due 
to SOB. Patient states that these symptoms began about a month 
ago and has worsened during the past few days. SOB, which he 
describes as ""hyperventilation"" occurs randomly and 
intermittently with no particular pattern-- at times with 
exertion, at rest, when feeling excited, or when talking. SOB 
resolves within 30 seconds after resting and ""meditating."" He 
has been taking his torsemide daily, but has been drinking more 
fluids (4 sodas/day) and began eating prepared food from a new 
___ grocery about 1.5 months ago. Denies any recent weight 
gain, chest pain, palpitations.  
Of note, he has a psychiatric history but psych symptoms are 
stable at this time but reports possibly some emotional distress 
about his girlfriend recent hysterectomy one week ago. His 
girlfriend just moved in over the last week after her 
hysterectomy and his symptoms started over the same time period. 
 
At one point he had been considered for LVAD, but that was 
deferred given he doesn't have a lot of social support. Last 
seen by ___ in ___ when he had a 10 pound weight loss (204 
-> 194) after increasing his torsomide and cutting down his soda 
intake from 6 cans/day to 3 cans/day.

IMAGING
===========
___ CXR
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Triple-lead left-sided AICD is similar in position.  No large 
pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains 
enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Right infrahilar 
opacity may relate to atelectasis and overlap of vascular 
structures but consolidation is not entirely excluded in the 
appropriate clinical setting; however, the appearance is likely 
similar to scout radiograph and chest CT from ___.  No 
pneumothorax. 

___ Stress Test
INTERPRETATION: ___ yo man with h/o non-ischemic, severe 
cardiomyopathy with LVEF ~ ___ was referred to evaluate his 
functional exercise tolerance. The patient completed 8 minutes 
and 30 
seconds of a 10 Watt ramping cycle ergometry protocol; peak 84 
Watts. 
The exercise test was stopped at the patient's request secondary 
to leg 
fatigue versus progressive shortness of breath. No chest, back, 
neck or 
arm discomforts were reported by the patient during the 
procedure. The 
ECG is uninterpretable for ischemia in the presence of the 
ventricular 
pacing. The rhythm was sinus with infrequent isolated VPBs 
noted. A flat 
blood pressure response to exercise was noted with a subtle drop 
in 
systolic blood pressure noted toward peak exercise. Peak 
exercise heart 
rate was blunted in the presence of beta blocker therapy. 
  
CARDIOPULMONARY DATA: 
  
Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) was 12.5 ml/kg/min (1029 
ml/min; 3.6 
METS). This represents 45% of the patient's predicted VO2peak of 
27.5 
ml/kg/min. Ventilatory threshold was difficult to determine in 
the 
setting of excessive oscillatory ventilaton noted from rest to 
peak 
exercise. Respiratory Exchange Ratio at peak exercise was 1.20 
indicating a maximal effort given by the patient. VE/VCO2 slope 
was 47 
indicating very poor ventilatory efficiency possibly secondary 
to poor 
perfusion and elevated pulmonary pressures. O2 pulse was also 
reduced at 
8 ml/beat (predicted 14 ml/beat) also an indication of poor 
perfusion 
and is considered an indirect assessment of stroke volume during 

exercise. 
  
IMPRESSION: Poor exercise tolerance (Weber Class C). Elevated 
VE/VCO2 
(Ventilatory Class IV) indicating poor perfusion and elevated 
pulmonary 
pressure. Blunted O2 pulse and blood pressure response to 
exercise. No 
anginal symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG.

and TR, CKD b/l ___ creatinine, with BiV ICD presents with 
intermittent SOB.  

ACUTE ISSUES

# SOB/dilated CMY: 
The patient's SOB was most likely due to an acute CHF 
exacerbation. His physical exam was notable for an S3, elevated 
JVP, in addition to an elevated BNP. Though he did not have 
crackles on lung exam, given his severe heart failure, he may 
not present with pulmonary edema or crackles due to lymphatic 
changes. He diuresed well with IV Lasix, and upon reaching a 
euvolemic state he was transitioned to PO Torsemide 100mg Daily, 
up from prior home dose of alternating 80 mg/100 mg daily. 

# CORONARIES/HLD: 
The patient does not have a known history of CAD. He did not 
present with chest pain or exertional symptoms concerning for 
acute coronary syndrome. His Tn was <.01 without ischemic 
changes on EKG.  He was continued on Aspirin, Atorvastatin, and 
Isosorbide Mononitrate. He was also started on Hydralazine 10mg 
TID to prevent tachyphylaxis with Isosorbide Mononitrate.

CHRONIC ISSUES

# CKD: 
The patient has known CKD with a baseline creatinine 1.7-2. His 
Cr was trended closely and medications were renally dosed.
 
# anxiety: The patient was continue on alprazolam:PRN  

# Paranoid schizophrenia: The patient was continued on 
olanzapine

IMAGING
========
___ ECHOCARDIOGRAM - TTE
Conclusions  
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The 
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe 
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ___ %). The 
estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses 
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular 
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall 
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and 
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The mitral 
valve leaflets do not fully coapt. Severe (4+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to 
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right 
atrial pressure.] There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the right ventricle is dilated with greater tricuspid 
regurgitation and higher estimated pulmonary arterial pressure. 
The appearance of the left ventricle is similar.   

___ ECG
Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing no 
change. 

___ CXR FINDINGS:  
Left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the 
regions of the right atrium, right ventricle and coronary sinus, 
unchanged.  Severe 
cardiomegaly is again noted.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are 
unchanged.  No pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  No focal 
consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  
Atelectasis is noted in both lung bases.  There are no acute 
osseous abnormalities. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Severe cardiomegaly without congestive heart failure or 
pneumonia. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction(EF 
___, nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, attributed to an 
anti-psychotic medication, mild pulmonary hypertension, ___ MR 
and TR, and CKD with baseline ___ creatinine, and ICD who 
presented with weakness and dyspnea. 

# Acute on Chronic Decompensated Heart Failure  
Upon arrival patient appeared hypervolemic based on JVP exam, 
the rest of the exam was not remarkable for hypervolemia 
(minimal pedal edema, lungs without major crackles). BNP was 
elevated to 30k from baseline 15k. He also had leukocytosis, 
transaminitis, and ___ on CKD. Patient was diuresed with IV 
lasix 200mg BID boluses with net fluid loss daily. After 
diuresis, patient's lab abnormalities improved and he returned 
to baselinine renal function, leukocytosis resolved and liver 
enzymes were downtrending. A repeat cardiac echo showed a LVEF 
___ and compared to echo from ___ the right ventricle is 
dilated with greater tricuspid regurgitation and higher 
estimated pulmonary arterial pressure.  Patient was started on 
hydralazine for afterload reduction given heart failure. EP was 
consulted to check for arrhythmias that could have precipitated 
exacerbation of CHF, but nothing substantial was found. Of note, 
patient's ICD is no longer BiV paced since ___ given chest wall 
stimulation. Also in ___ LV lead could not be replaced d/t 
anatomic structure. Upon discharge patient was on 100 mg 
torsemide daily with a return to baseline of his symptoms. He 
occasionally had short runs of asymptomatic non-sustained 
ventricular tachycardia. Discharge weight: 73.1kg. 

#Mitral Regurgiation/TR - severe MR and mod/sev TR. Will benefit 
from afterload reduction. Started on hydralazine 10mg TID in 
addition to isordil.

# Transaminitis  
ALT/AST to 300s with mild elevation of Tbili to 2.2 on 
admission. Normal RUQ U/S reported at OSH without evidence of 
obstruction. Mild liver heterogenetity. Trace ascites. 
Coagulopathy initially with INR of 1.1 at discharge. Most likely 
congestive hepatopathy that improved with diuresis. Labwork for 
hepatitis A,B,C and HIV was negative. 
 
#Leukocytosis on presentation. Infectious work-up was negative. 
Resolved with diuresis. Most likely cause was CHF exacerbation. 

# Acute on chronic kidney disease  
Significantly elevated from prior baseline 1.7-2.2. Creatinine 
3.2 on admission. Most likely a reflection of cardiorenal 
process with CHF exacerbation. Resolved with diuresis with Cr 
1.6 at discharge. Of note, has only R kidney per abdominal US 
though patient does not remember. Had RCC of the other kidney. 
UA with urine lytes unremarkable. 

#Fe Deficiency Anemia. TIBC borderline normal/high. Low Iron, 
low ferritin. Most likely iron def anemia. B12 high.Patient was 
anemic on admission and iron studies were consistent with iron 
deficiency. His iron was repleted with iron gluconate.

#Schizophrenia - was well controlled on home medications during 
hospitalization.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
#Discharge weight: 73.1kg
#Patient is Hepatitis B surface antibody negative - consider 
vaccination as an outpatient. 
#Transaminitis - f/u to check for resolution. Most likely cause 
was congestive hepatopathy from CHF. If not resolved consider 
further workup. 
#Iron deficiency anemia - check for improving hemoglobin and 
further iron administration/work-up if not improving. Make sure 
patient is up to date on colon cancer screening.
#started on hydralazine for afterload reduction. Monitor for 
signs/symptoms of hypotension at follow up.
#Not on an ___ d/t history of hypotension. Consider 
restarting if blood pressures permit in the future

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure meeting you and taking care of you while you 
were at the ___. You were 
admitted to us after worsening shortness of breath. In the 
hospital it was determined that you had too much fluid retention 
in your body from the heart failure causing your symptoms of 
shortness of breath. You were given medicine to help you urinate 
the extra fluid. Before discharge you were given tosemide which 
is a diuretic (water pill) to help you maintain your fluid 
balance. In addition you were started on a medicine called 
hydralazine which lowers blood pressure and can help with some 
symptoms of your heart failure. It is important to continue 
eating low sodium foods when you are at home and to restriciting 
yourself to 2 liters of fluids per day. You need to call and 
schedule a follow up with your primary care physician. You 
already have a follow up scheduled with your cardioligist, Dr. 
___. You should weigh yourself every morning, and call your MD 
if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in a 24 hour period.

We wish you the best of health,

Your ___ Care Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

Thank you for coming to ___. It 
was a pleasure to care for you.

You come to the hospital because you were feeling short of 
breath and had difficulty breathing when lying down. We found 
that you had collected extra fluid in your lungs that was making 
it hard for you to breathe. You received medications 
(Lasix)intravenously that helped you take off the extra fluid. 
We are changing your home torsemide dose to 160 mg. 

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

request now transferred to CCU for cardiogenic shock.

# CORONARIES: Unknown
# PUMP: EF ___
# RHYTHM: V-paced
 
# Cardiogenic shock/Acute decompensated systolic heart failure: 
Nonischemic CMP with EF ___. Presenting with progressive SOB, 
___ ___, Trop negative. Not responsive to high dose 
diuretics (s/p 1000mg IV Diuril and 200mg IV Lasix). He was 
started on dobutamine, levophed to maintain MAP 60-70. He 
received 1000 mg chlorothiazide and 200 mg IV lasix. Swan was 
placed ___ in the LIJ. Upon arrival to the CCU, patient was

___ s/p discontinuation of dobutamine CVP 7/PAP 50/30(37) CO 
4.3/CI 2.3/ SVR 1309/MVO2 62%. The swan was removed and Lasix 
drip titrated so patient remained net even. Upon discontinuation 
of dobuatmine/Lasix gtt, patient remained warm/well perfused 
with flat JVD; he was started on isordil 10 mg TID, hydralazine 
10 mg BID, digoxin 0.125mg. Once hemodynamically stable, patient 
was restarted on metoprolol XL 100 mg daily. In discussion with 
Dr. ___ was decided to hold sprinolactone. Additionally, 
his diuretic regimen was optimized and patient was discharged on 
80 mg torsemide daily for a goal to stay evolumeic.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ with congestive heart failure. Upon 
arrival, you were having difficulty breathing and were 
cold/clammy. A breathing tube was placed and your breathing 
assisted, a line was placed to measure the pressures around your 
heart and a medication called dobutamine was used to help with 
your heart failure; extra fluid was removed using a medication 
called furoseimide. The breathing tube was removed, the 
dobutamine was stopped and your heart failure was controlled. 

You should take the following medications to help with the 
functioning of your heart: 
Imdur (isosorbide dinitrated) 30 mg every day 
Hydralazine 10 mg three times a day 
Metoprolol Succinate XL 100 mg daily 
Digoxin 0.125 mg daily 
It is important to take these medications as prescribed. If you 
feel lightheaded, dizzy call your doctor. 

Additionally you will take a medication to help remove extra 
fluid from your body called 
Torsemide 80 mg daily 
You should weight yourself daily. Your weight when you left the 
hospital was 150 lbs (68 kg). If you gain or lose three pounds 
you should call your doctor. 

While you were in the hospital, you were found to have blood 
clots in the veins in your left arm. We started a medication to 
prevent further blood clots called: 
warfarin 4 mg daily. 
You will need to get weekly blood draws to ensure the medication 
is at the right level. Dr. ___ will follow your INR. 

Warfarin prevents your blood from clotting too easily. If you 
fall, hit your head, or have a car accident, you should report 
to the emergency room. 

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care 
___ care team

IMPORTANT IMAGING/STUDIES:
==========================
CXR (___): Compared to chest radiographs ___ through 
___.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Pleural effusions are 
small if any.  No 
pneumothorax. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  Combination of 
trans vascular and epicardial pacing an defibrillator device is 
unchanged.  No pneumothorax.

Unilateral upper extremity US: 1.  Occlusive left distal 
cephalic vein thrombus. 2.  Remaining left upper extremity veins 
are patent without evidence of thrombus. 

CXR (___): Pullback of right PICC is recommended by 7 cm for 
termination at the cavoatrial junction. 

CXR (___): Right PICC line terminates in lower SVC.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with past medical history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 
(EF 15%) s/p BiV ICD with upgrade to CRT-D (recently 
interrogated and functioning appropriately), HTN, HLD, and 
paranoid schizophrenia who presented with chest pain, found to 
have volume overload consistent with CHF exacerbation. He 
unfortunately passed away on ___.

#Death
#Acute on chronic systolic CHF, decompensated:
On admission, patient was volume overloaded and hypotensive. He 
was admitted to the CCU, where he was diuresed with Lasix IV and 
continued on his home hydralazine and Imdur for afterload 
reduction. Throughout his CCU course, he became more hypotensive 
and was started on dobutamine drip with initial improvement in 
his blood pressure. He subsequently became more hypotensive 
while on dobutamine drip, requiring levophed gtt and midodrine 
to maintain MAP>60. We attempted multiple times to wean him off 
his infusions with no success given hypotension. He was 
eventually transitioned to a dopamine drip with the goal keeping 
him on one drip to be discharged on. However, he expired on 
___.

#GOC: Throughout his hospital stay, there was discussion with 
him regarding his goals of care in context of his end-stage 
heart failure. Eventually he decided to transition to comfort 
measures prior to expiring.

#Chest pain: Likely was demand ischemia in setting of CHF 
exacerbation. He had no ischemic changes on ECG and his trop/MB 
remained flat from admission.

#Acute on chronic kidney disease: Likely prerenal in setting of 
CHF exacerbation. His serum creatinine was followed for 
improvement. A digoxin level was checked and was 
supratherapeutic, so his digoxin was held and then eventually 
discontinued.

#Coagulopathy: INR was 4.1 on admission. Patient seemed unsure 
of his Coumadin regimen and states that he has had 
supratherapeutic INR before. His coumadin was held and 
eventually discontinued.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#Paranoid schizophrenia, depression, anxiety: He was continued 
on his home Olanzapine and Alprazolam.

#HLD: He was continued on his home statin, but this was 
discontinued upon discharge.

___ esophagus: He was originally continued on his 
home omeprazole.

#Insomnia: His ambien was held originally, but it was restarted 
to improve his sleep.

MICRO:
Blood cultures ___: Pending

IMAGING:
CXR PA/lateral ___
There is subtle right basilar opacity and lack of visualization 
of 
the right heart border. There is minimal increased density 
projecting over the cardiac sillouette on the lateral view. 
Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette 
is normal. No acute osseous abnormality is identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: Loss of the right heart border with subtle increased 
right lower lung opacity which could represent right middle lobe 
pneumonia. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ F h/o DMI diagnosed at age ___ with no prior h/o DKA, 
hypothyroidism, epilepsy, HLD, anxiety who presents with nausea, 
vomiting and hyperglycemia.

ACTIVE ISSUES

#) Hyperglycemia: Likely DKA given blood sugars elevated to the 
300s and h/o DMI, with evidence of ketonuria. Precipitant 
unclear; most likely due to malfunctioning pump. Other possible 
precipitants included infection such as viral gastroenteritis or 
pneumonia. Initial AG was 24. She was treated with insulin drip 
and her gap closed.  She was transitioned to BID Lantus and 
Humalog sliding scale insulin. She was seen by ___ who 
provided recommendations for insulin titration. She was also 
seen by a diabetes nurse educator who provided recommendations 
to transition the patient back onto her pump prior to discharge. 
She was transiently hyperglycemic on the night prior to 
discharge, as expected given her transition from glargine and 
humalog injections back onto her pump and received a correction 
bolus. She is discharged home with ketone strips and will follow 
up in the ___ clinic 2 days after discharge on ___.

#) Leukocytosis: Differential diagnosis included infection 
versus hemoconcentration.  Infection could be viral 
gastroenteritis based on abrupt onset of nausea and vomiting 
(though these symptoms could be a manifestation of DKA rather 
than precipitant). CXR revealed impressive obscuration of right 
heart border, which may represent aspiration pneumonia versus 
pneumonitis in the setting of nausea/vomiting.  She did not have 
SOB or cough to suggest typical or atypical PNA. She did not 
have dysuria to suggest UTI. Considered influenza given reported 
myalgias, generalized weakness and subjective fever, though 
patients illness began with abrupt onset GI distress making flu 
less likely.  Leukocytosis may be a reflection of 
hemoconcentration to some extent given elevated albumin and 
Hgb/Hct approaching upper range of normal with significant 
decrease in all cell lines after receiving IVF fluids. She was 
started on azithro/CTX for five-day course and then transitioned 
to azithro monotherapy. 

CHRONIC ISSUES

#) Hypothyroidism:  Continued home levothyroxine.

#) Epilepsy: Continued home lamotrigine.

#) HLD: Continued home simvastatin.

#) Anxiety: Continued home alprazolam.  Continued home 
fluoxetine.

# Type 1 DM, poorly controlled (recent A1c 10%). Patient 
initially presented with weakness, abdominal pain, SOB, found to 
have FSBG of 424 and initial VBG of ___ and was 
admitted for DKA. Most likely etiology is insulin pump 
malfunction as per patient's history. Patient was started on 
insulin drip of 6 units/hr, received IVF per protocol with 
aggressive K repletion. Once anion gap was closed, patient was 
started on SQ insulin with insulin pump with ___ following. 
Transitioned to the floor, where basal insulin rate was titrated 
down for some low episodes. Discharged with intent to follow-up 
with PCP and ___. Patient was informed that she should she be 
started on steroids as an outpatient, she should contact ___ 
immediately to change her insulin.

# Evaluation for Sarcoidosis. Seen in pulmonary clinic at 
beginning of ___ with clinical presentation, imaging, 
markedly elevated ACE level concerning for sarcoidosis. 
Transferred from ___ to ___ as she is set to 
undergo biopsy with IP and Dr. ___ on ___. Patient underwent 
bronchoscopy with endobronchial US and transbronchial needle 
aspiration on ___ with mediastinal lymph node biopsy, with 
post-procedural issues as below. Biopsy was pending at time of 
discharge. 

# Post-Bronch PNA: After procedure, patient developed a 3L O2 
requirement with fevers and dyspnea. CXR with new infiltrates 
bilaterally. This persisted for 3 days post-bronch, longer than

Chief Complaint:
Progressive weakness, progressive dyspnea now at rest. 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old right-handed man with a history 
including childhood polio, remote alcohol abuse, diet-controlled 
DM, SVT s/p ablation, and CKD who presents with acute worsening 
of a ___ month history of dyspnea in the setting of a nine-month 
history of progressive weakness, muscle cramping, 
fasciculations, dysphagia, weak cough, and unintentional weight 
loss. 
 
According to notes, the shortness of breath started almost one 
year ago.  Initially, it was most notable with ambulation and 
exertion.  In the past ___ months, however, Mr. ___ has had 
trouble breathing during more sedentary activities.  He has 
marked difficulty lying flat.  For the syndrome, he has 
presented for evaluation on several occasions.  He was initially 
found to have SVT.  He underwent ablation in ___ with no 
recurrence based on holter monitoring.  A stress test (___) 
was unrevealing.  Echo (___) showed left atrial dilation and 
LVH with a normal LVEF.  
 
He has also visited with the pulmonology team.  Investigatiry 
studies revealed a possible restrictive ventilatory deficit.  
There was no asymmetry of the diaphragm noted on CXR from 
___. The pulmonary team raised concern about ALS when the 
patient was noted to have fasciculations on examination.  
(Accordingly, the patient was scheduled to see Dr. ___ 
___.  The patient and family have noted the fasciculations 
in all limbs, and indicate they have become progressively 
pronounced.  The fasciculations or ""body tremors""  occur in 
combination with muscle craming and weakness.
  
According to all accounts, Mr. ___ started to notice the 
gradual onset of weakness in the ___.  He recalls 
distal lower exrtemity weakness first, saying he tripped over 
his feet sometimes.  Over time he developed proximal weakness; 
he had trouble climbing out of cars and rising from seats.  More 
recently, he developed difficulty with fine finger movements and 
now has keeping his arms above his head to complete tasks.  
There was no clear trigger.  There are no exacerbating factors, 
and the symptoms do not seem to worsen throughout the day or get 
better after rest.  There are no alleviating factors.  
  
The weakness has been associated with many other symptoms 
including weight loss; he has unintentionally lost about 30 
pounds in the last 6 months.  He attributes the weight loss to 
anorexia.  He thinks that most of the weight loss manifests as 
loss of muscle mass.  For the weight loss and systemic symptoms, 
Mr. ___ has undergone CXR and colonoscopy which were negative. 
 He has also had HIV testing, which was negative.
  
He presents to the ED today due to increasing respiratory 
distress.  Due to initial tachycardia, tachypnea, and use of 
accessory muscles, he was placed on bipap.  Since that time, his 
vital signs have normalized.  Neurology is consulted for 
evaluation of an underlying neurological cause of respiratory
weakness.

EMG of left extensor hallucis longus showed moderate, chronic 
reinnervation, mild ongoing denervation, and 
moderately-to-markedly reduced recruitment. 
   
EMG of left vastus lateralis showed borderline, chronic 
reinnervation, mild fasciculations, complex repetitive 
discharges, and slightly reduced 
recruitment. 
  
EMG of left genioglossus appeared normal but was limited by the 
patient's 
inability to fully relax. 
   
EMG of left masseter was normal. 
  
EMG of left mid-thoracic paraspinal muscles showed severe 
ongoing denervation. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal study. The electrophysiologic evidence is consistent 
with a disorder of motor neurons or their axons. In addition, 
the electrophysiologic data is  suggestive of a mild, 
generalized, sensorimotor polyneuropathy with axonal  features. 
The absent left ulnar sensory response is of uncertain clinical 
significance. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo RHM with history of childhood polio, remote alcohol abuse,
diet-controlled DM, SVT s/p ablation, and CKD presents with
acute worsening of a ___ month history of dyspnea in the setting
of a nine-month history of progressive weakness, muscle 
cramping,
fasciculations, dysphagia, weak cough, and unintentional weight
loss. 

The patient was in respiratory distress upon presentation to the 
ED. Due to initial tachycardia, tachypnea, and use of accessory 
muscles, he was placed on bipap. His vital signs normalized and 
he appeared more comfortable, though he did complain of 
claustrophobia with the mask. Initial neurologic examination 
reveals diffuse fasciculations, concerning for motor neuron 
disease. 

The patient was admitted to the neuro ICU. The patient was 
weaned off BiPAP, and stabilized on oxygen by nasal canula. 
After this he remained stable from a respiratory standpoint, 
with 02 saturations > 94% even during sleep. 

Given the high suspicion of motor neuron disease, and EMG was 
peformed and this was consistent with ALS. CT torso was done to 
rule out underlying malignancy, and this was negative. What is 
unusual about his pattern of weakness is that for a patient with 
ALS, and respiratory failure, he is not as weak as I would have 
expected. THis still raises the issue of post polio syndrome 
with respiratory failure although his EMG was suggestive of ALS. 

The patient and his family were informed of the diagnosis in a 
family meeting. They worked with social work and palliative care 
teams. The patient wished to return home, and he will receive 
home services and home ___ by nasal canula. He was set up for 
follow up in the ___ clinic. 

The patient was a FULL CODE during this admission. During 
repeated code status discussions, the patient expresses wishes 
not to be intubated if there was no chance of recovery, but was 
not ready to sign the papers.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ was admitted to the ICU after his operation. His 
initial ___ was complicated by return to OR for hemothorax 
evacuation. After this, he returned to the ICU, but was able to 
be transferred to the floor on POD ___. His post-operative 
course may be described by systems as below:

Neuro: He was intubated/sedated after each of his operations. 
Once appropriate, he was extubated without issue. He was 
initially given IV pain medications for pain control, and 
transitioned to oral medications once appropriate. He tolerated 
this well.

CV: Required phenylephrine for blood pressure after first 
operation; this was successfully weaned. He once more required 
pressors again after second operation, also weaned without 
issue. After that, he remained hemodynamically stable throughout 
his stay. Due to the aforementioned times of hypotension and 
pressor requirement, Cardiology was consulted and MI was ruled 
out by means of serial EKGs and troponin checks. The patient was 
eventually diuresed gently due to his multiple fluid 
resuscitations with increased risk for CHF. He tolerated this 
well. He had no arrhythmias post op but was started on, and will 
continue on Diltiazem for afib prophylaxis for an additional 3 
weeks.

Pulm: He was extubated when appropriate post-operatively. On 
POD1, his chest tube output had decreased, then suddenly put out 
240 cc of serosanguinous output, then improved. The chest tube 
was removed. However, overnight POD1-2, there was concern for 
hemothorax on CXR and drop in Hct. A chest tube was placed and 
he returned to the operating room for an exploratory thoracotomy 
and evacuation of hematoma. Afterwards, he was once more 
extubated when appropriate. The chest tube was removed on POD 
___ and repeat CXR showed no PTX. His weight was elevated, so 
diuresis was begun with furosemide as mentioned above, till he 
returned to his pre-operative dry weight.

GI: He had emesis after each operation, thought to be likely due 
to anesthesia effect. Eventually, however, he tolerated a 
regular diet, though did have a decreased appetite. He was 
started on Marinol to assist with this. He had normal bowel 
movements throughout his stay.

GU: He initially had a foley catheter in place for close urine 
output monitoring. When appropriate, this was removed, and he 
voided successfully without issue.

Endo: no active issues

Heme: Aforementioned hematocrit drop required takeback to OR. 
Hct monitored closely after that, and remained stable 
throughout. 

ID: He received ___ antibiotics for prophylaxis.

The patient was doing well and discharged on ___. He will 
stay locally for approximately one week and then follow up with 
Dr. ___ prior to returning to ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ man w/PMH of COPD (last FEV1/FVC in ___: 53%), HCV, 
HBV and posttraumatic seizure disorder since ___ admitted to 
the orthopedic service on ___ s/p fall with R-sided rib 
fractures and PTX.  He had a chest tube placed and was monitored 
for lung reexpansion.   

#S/p fall - Pt presented to the ED 4 days out from fall with  R 
sided rib fractures ___, moderate sized R pneumothorax. Pig tail 
was placed in the ED and pt admitted to the surgical service. 
His pneumothorax improved and pig tail was pulled on HD4 with 
out any issues. The cause for his fall is unknown, it may have 
been a mechanical vs. seizure-related fall as he said he was 
attempting to self-wean himself off his antiepileptic 
medications.  

# Hypoxia - Increased O2 requirement from 2L->3L NC.  Speaking 
in short phrases with significant SOB.  Pt was found still found 
to be hypoxic upon arrival to the medicine service, which was 
thought to be due to PE vs. COPD vs pneumonia. After he was 
transferred to our service, we obtained a CTA to rule out PE.  
The CT did not show a PE and confirmed the fact that his COPD 
was very severe, and it was thought that his baseline O2 sat 
were likely 88-92% at home.  He had been placed on antibiotics 
for possible pneumonia prior to transfer to medicine; he was 
treated with Levofloxacin for presumed PNA started on ___, as 
well as duonebs q6 and tramadol for pain.  On ___, per CXR, it 
appeared his PNA had cleared.  Though he may have had a PNA, his 
hypoxia is most likely attributable to acute COPD exacerbation 
in the setting of recent URI and recent fall c/b PTX w/pigtail 
d/c ___. Improved from admission, but still persistently hypoxic 
with supplemental O2 requirement. We gave him albuterol and 
ipratroprium nebulizer treatments, prednisone 60 mg daily for a 
5 day course, supplemental O2, and encouraged use of incentive 
spirometry to help improve his respiratory status.  He 
clinically appeared improved, but was O2 dependent and required 
home O2.  Patient is s/p fall c/b R-PTX now s/p pigtail 
placement with gradual improvement of respiratory status.  
Likely multifactorial in the setting of URI ?CAP completed a 5d 
course of levaquin, COPD with 56py smoking history, and recent 
fall c/b R-PTX. Prior to transfer, he was on a shovel mask at 6L 
on ___ cannula on ___ -> on 2L of oxygen since ___ with 
desats to ___ with ambulation.  He did not receive lasix because 
the Ortho/trauma team did not feel this was related to CHF 
exacerbation in any way, nor did the patient look volume 
overloaded to them.  Patient refused to go to rehab.  His oxygen 
requirement improved during the hospitalization.  We had him 
evaluated for home O2, and he was discharged on 2L O2. 

#PNA - He had been placed on antibiotics for possible pneumonia 
prior to transfer to medicine; he was treated with Levofloxacin 
for presumed PNA that was started on ___, as well as duonebs 
q6 and tramadol for pain.  On ___, per CXR, it appeared his PNA 
had cleared. CT on ___ reporting increased LLL consolidation 
and positive sputum culture ___ worrisome for HCAP. On ___, he 
began to produce yellow sputum but clinically did not appear to 
be worse. CT chest ___ revealed increased LLL consolidation 
compared to CT chest ___, with interval CXR on ___ revealing the 
absence of any focal consolidation, suggesting his initial CAP 
may have cleared. There was some bibasilar consolidation on CT 
___ that appeared to have resolved after starting levaquin, as 
CXR on ___ reported absence of any focal consolidation. This 
newly increased LLL consolidation is worrisome for HCAP, 
particularly given sputum cx ___ revealing GPC in clusters. 
However, he clinically does not appear sick, afebrile, no 
elevated WBC, and has even had decreased O2 requirement today 
(down to 1.5L). Given concern for HCAP, he was given one dose on 
___ of vancomycin 1000mg IV Q12H (day 1: ___, Cefepime 2g IV 
Q12H (day 1: ___. Given that he clinically appeared to be 
doing better and expressed the desire to return home, we 
discontinued his antibiotics, and requested that he return to 
the hospital should his symptoms worsen.  We recommended that he 
follow-up with his PCP for ___ repeat CXR in ___ weeks to ensure 
that the pneumonia had clear and that this was not a 
postobstructive pneumonia.

# PTX ___ rib fx: Resolved prior to transfer to medicine, s/p 
removal of pigtail. For persistent pain around the fracture 
site, we continued him on dilaudid PO Q3H, tramadol, tylenol PRN 
pain.

# Afib with RVR: He triggered for afib with RVR while on the 
orthopedic service.  He was in sinus on arrival to the medicine 
service, and his afib had resolved.  

# Seizure history: Posttraumatic seizure disorder s/p MVA in 
___, originally diagnosed in ___.  Controlled with 
lamictal at home.  No seizures since before ___. We recommended 
that he see a neurologist as an outpatient or return to the 
Epilepsy clinic at ___ for further management of this AEDs.

# HCV: h/o IVDU. VL in ___ 2.6 x10^6. Not on treatment.
# HTN: He was normotensive while hospitalized and we held his 
antihypertensives.
# HLD: We continued his statin while inpatient.

RADIOLOGY:
============
CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  Linear opacity projecting over the anterior right 
seventh rib may relate to the edge of the rib.  No definite 
focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.  The aorta is slightly tortuous and is calcified.  
The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Metallic surgical 
hardware is partially imaged in the cervical spine.  Evidence of 
underlying pulmonary emphysema is seen. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

LENIS ___:
FINDINGS:  There is normal compressibility, flow and 
augmentation of the right common femoral, proximal femoral, mid 
femoral, distal femoral and popliteal veins.  Normal color-flow 
and compressibility is seen in the right posterior tibial and 
peroneal veins.  There is normal respiratory variation in the 
common femoral veins bilaterally. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right 
lower extremity. 

CTA ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1.  6.9 cm soft tissue mass with central hypodensity in the 
middle mediastinum surrounding the right main pulmonary artery, 
concerning for malignancy with central necrosis.  The mass also 
compresses the distal trachea.  Tissue sampling with 
bronchoscopy is recommended. 
2.  Right apical pleural-based soft tissue mass may represent 
metastatic 
disease. 
3.  Focal non-occlusive subsegmental pulmonary embolus in the 
right lower 
lobe. 
4.  Mild dilation of the pulmonary arterial trunk may be related 
in part to mass effect on the pulmonary arteries by the 
mediastinal mass. 
5.  Small pericardial effusion. 

CTH ___:
IMPRESSION:  No change in the faint hyperdensity in the region 
of the left 
basal ganglia, suggesting it is likely mineralization in the 
globus pallidus related to age. No acute hemorrhage is 
identified. 

CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient 
is less 
rotated.  There is no evidence for the presence of a right 
pneumothorax.  Mild atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas.  
Known mediastinal masses. 

CTH ___:
IMPRESSION: 
Subtle 7 mm hyperdensity near the anterior limb of the left 
internal capsule. This is concerning for a small 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  Alternatively, this could 
represent focal mineralization of the basal ganglia.  In the 
absence of prior imaging for comparison, close follow-up is 
advised. 
   
COMMENT ON ATTENDING REVIEW: 
  
The faint hyperdensity in the region of the left basal ganglia, 
without 
surrounding edema, is not consistent with hemorrhage. It likely 
represents 
either age-related mineralization of the globus pallidus or 
mineralization 
with a cavernous malformation. 

TTE ___:
The left atrial volume is mildly increased. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%). The estimated 
cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Doppler parameters are 
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. The right 
ventricular size is normal with normal free wall contractility. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary 
hypertension.

found to have a new mediastinal mass in addition to subsegmental 
PEs. He was transitioned to comfort-focused care in the ICU and 
expired on the general medicine floor.  

ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES:
==========================
# Mediastinal Mass: 
Unclear etiology however rapid progression concerning for 
lymphoma vs. SCLC. Pt stated he was not interested in undergoing 
a biopsy at this time but upon further discussion with his wife 
and pt, had discussion with IP about possibly getting biopsy. 
This was deferred based on goals of care.

#Respiratory failure and Comfort Focused Care: Pt presented with 
worsening respiratory status likely due to compressive effects 
of mass, PEs. He was initially stabilized in the MICU, called 
out to the floor, then re-transferred to MICU for respiratory 
distress. He was altered/delirious by then. At that time goals 
of care discussion was held with his wife, and in line with his 
wishes when patient was still mentating well, it was decided not 
to pursue further workup, not to intubate, and to focus 
primarily on patinet's comfort.

# Subsegmental PEs:
Noted on CTA. Unclear if patient was symptomatic from clots as 
burden was low.  No evidence of hemodynamic compromise. Pt 
started on heparin gtt while in MICU with goal PTT of 60-80. 
This was later stopped based on goals of care as above.

# Afib with RVR- Patient with afib with RVR in the ED. He 
converted to sinus after bolus dose of dilt. Pt admitted to MICU 
with HR in the ___.  CADS2 score of 0. Pt started on low dose 
metoprolol while in MICU and remained in sinus rhythm.

# Leg pain- Pt with R leg pain on admission, etiology unclear. 
Pt had negative ___. Plain films were ordered but pt declined.  


# Pericardial effusion- Pt noted that have pericardial effusion, 
possibly related to malignancy. Small in size without evidence 
of hemodynamic compromise. Formal echo showed small/trivial 
pericardial effusion.

# Leukocytosis- Pt presented with ___ ct of 14 although was 
without current infectious symptoms.  CXR without evidence of 
PNA.  UA negative.  No history of GI symptoms. No recent fevers 
or chills. Leukocytosis possibly related to PE. No antibiotics 
were started and pt's wbc was trended.

CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES: 
=========================
# Seizure disorder- Pt was initially continued on home meds.

# COPD- Patient has notable wheezing on exam. He was continued 
home spiriva with prn nebs 

# HTN- Pt not on medications at home. Pt normotensive in MICU.

# Hepatitis C- Per report HCV:  VL in ___ 2.6 x10^6. Not 
currently on treatment.   

# Tobacco abuse- patient with > 50 pack year history. Pt was 
offered nicotine patch.

Chief Complaint:
Assault/EtOH withdrawal
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
 ___ with past medical history of ETOH withdrawal and seizure 
who presents after an assault early on AM of admission. In the 
ED, he reported that someone attempted to get money from him for 
marijuana at which point he was assualted. 

In the ED, initial VS were 98.0 105 153/77 20 98% RA.  Labs 
notable for clean UA (no bloodwork sent).  CT head showed small 
posterior subgaleal hematoma but no intracranial bleed. CT 
sinus/mandible showed communited fracture of nasal bone through 
nasal septum.  CT C-spine showed possible avulsion injury of 
superior endplate of C5, no compression Fx or retropulsion.  
C-spine flex-ex was normal; CT abdomen-pelvis showed no acute 
abdominal process.  Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and felt 
no evaluation was necessary.  The patient was initially 
comfortable but became tremulous, tachycardic, and c/o HA, 
suspicious for EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 5 mg Diazepam 
CIWA Q2H; this was insufficient, so he was escalated to 20 mg 
Q1H for a brief period in the ED.  This controlled his 
withdrawal symptoms and he was noted to be drowsy but arousable 
thereafter.  He was switched to Q2H Diazepam and admitted.  He 
also received thiamine, folate, Ibuprofen, and Zofran.  VS on 
transfer were 85 113/76 19 97%.

On arrival to the floor, patient reports that he has a bad 
headache and feels shaky. His last drink was early this AM 
(before 6 AM). He drank particularly heavily overnight, 
reporting ___ beers and ""lots"" of whisky shots. He normally 
drinks one 6-pack of beers and several shots every day or every 
other day.

___ BLOOD CULTURE - NGTD (PENDING)

STUDIES:
___ CXR: Interval recurrence or progression of diffuse 
alveolar 
opacification in setting of known chronic interstitial lung 
disease (NSIP/ILD leading diagnostic considerations per OMR). 
This could be pulmonary edema or widespread pneumonia or 
hemorrhage. Given the course consideration should also be given 
to drug or toxin exposure exacerbating a preexisting reaction. 

___ TTE:  Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity 
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Normal left ventricular 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function. Mild mitral 
stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the right ventricular findings are new and suggestive of 
myocardial contusion. The severity of mitral stenosis has 
increased. The severity of mitral regurgitation has declined 
(may be due to tachycardia and suboptimal image quality).

___ EKG: Sinus rhythm and increase in rate as compared to 
the previous tracing of ___. There is right axis deviation 
and low limb lead voltage. There is now ST segment elevation in 
leads V1-V3 with biphasic to inverted T waves in leads V1-V5, 
more prominent as compared to the previous tracing of ___. 
The rate is increased. These findings are consistent with active 
anterolateral ischemic process. Followup and clinical 
correlation are suggested.  

CTA Wet read ___:
No PE. Some consolidations/septal thickening suggestive of fluid 
vs infection. Enlarged pulm artery suggestive of pulmonary HTN. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with history of advanced 
interstitial lung disease, likely NSIP, CHF, DM, and chronic 
pain s/p MVA who presents with respiratory failure. 

ICU Course:
Patient was intubated in the ED secondary to respiratory 
distress and oxygen saturations in the ___. She was admitted to 
the MICU were a CVL was placed. She was treated initially 
empirically with levofloxacin and broadened to 
vancomycin/cefepime/azithromycin for empiric coverage of HCAP. 
She was also given IV steroids, then transitioned to prednisone 
40 mg daily, for an ILD flare per her outpatient pulmonologist, 
Dr. ___. Influenza swab was sent and returned negative. Sputum 
cultures grew commensal respiratory flora and yeast. She was 
also diuresed with IV lasix given an elevated BNP of 1023 over 
her baseline of 363 from ___ and overload on CXR. IV Lasix 
40mg IV was effective and diuresis. Echocardiogram showed 
findings of RV free wall hypokinesis c/w contusion related to 
MVA as well as mild MS ___ MR. ___ cardiology recommended 
further evaluation with TEE as this valvular disease may be 
contributing to her heart failure. She was extubated on ___ 
with return to her baseline home oxygen requirement. Just prior 
to transfer to the floor patient was started on morphine 
60mg/30mg/60mg PO TID for her chronic fibromyalgia neck and 
shoulder pain.

*ACTIVE ISSUES*
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure:  The patient is on 
daily lasix 60 mg at home and has a history of chronic diastolic 
heart failure secondary to rheumatic heart disease (echo in ___ 
showed EF>55%, mild-mod MV regurg).  Her dyspnea was thought to 
be due to volume retention in the setting of starting steroids 
for baseline lung disease.  In the MICU she was started on IV 
lasix 40 mg with good response.  On the floor her lung exam was 
notable for bibasilar crackles and high-pitched inspiratory 
squeaks, as well as bipedal pitting edema.  She was therefore 
continued on IV lasix with resolution of dyspnea and improved 
lung exam.  Her oxgen requirement was lowered to her baseline of 
6L NC.  A repeat CXR on ___ showed substantial improvement in 
pulmonary edema compared to the prior study of ___.  To 
evaluate the role of mitral valve dysfunction on CHF 
exacerbation, she also underwent a repeat echo given poor window 
of bedside TTE in the MICU.  The echo was largely unchanged from 
her prior in ___, with preserved EF 70% and mild resting left 
ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Rheumatic mitral valve 
deformity was noted along with mild MV stenosis.  Cardiology 
recommended starting the patient on low-dose metoprolol due to 
concern for CHF exacerbation from tachycardia/decreased filling 
time in the setting of the patient's MR/MS. ___ tolerated 
metoprolol succinate 12.5mg daily well. The patient was 
transitioned to po lasix 40 mg, and on this low dose continued 
to produce output ___ daily.  She appeared consistently 
euvolemic on this dose.  Her Cr remained stable throughout this 
period.  On discharge her weight was 100.2 kg, compared to her 
baseline weight of 101.2 kg (___).  The CTA on day of 
discharge revealed signs of some fluid overload and decision was 
made to send her home on 60mg daily (her usual home dose) and to 
likely taper down to 40mg daily if appropriate when she sees her 
primary care physician. She was discharged on lasix 60mg daily 
and metoprolol 12.5 mg daily. Pt was satting in the mid-high ___ 
on 6L at time of discharge.

# ILD: The patient has advanced interstitial lung disease with 
tissue diagnosis of fibrotic NSIP in ___. She is on baseline 6L 
O2 at home and is followed closely by Dr. ___.  While 
inhouse it was thought that her lung disease was contributing to 
her dyspnea and acute presentation.  She was therefore continued 
on prednisone 40 mg po daily.  The patient was seen by Dr. ___ 
___ recommended a slow steroid taper over ___ months with 
possible outpatient transition to azathioprine. Given her 
continuation of steroids, she was started on a PPI. She was also 
started on PCP prophylaxis with bactrim and discharged on 
Cal/VitD. 

# Diabetes mellitus:  The patient had poor glycemic control 
during her stay, with post-meal FSBG levels consistently >400.  
A HgA1c was 9.2.  Her lantus was increased to 24 from baseline 
20 with good effect.  She was started on a novolog sliding scale 
with frequent adjustment.  ___ saw the patient while inhouse 
for elevated sugars. The decision was made to STOP metformin 
given her CHF, and the patient was instructed not to resume this 
outpatient.  She was discharged on lantus 24 U qhs and novolog 
sliding scale (Starting breakfast and lunch at 12 for BG 
100-150, increase by 2; dinner at 8 Units for BG 100-150, 
increase by 2; bedtime at 4 for BG 151-200, increase by 2).

# Chronic pain s/p MVA:  Baseline chronic back pain was 
controlled with her home morphine dose 60mg/30mg/60mg PO TID 
which was started in the MICU.  She had adequate pain control 
during her hospitalization. 

*INACTIVE ISSUES:*
# Anemia:  The patient is chronically anemic and remained so 
with Hcts ranging from 27.9-31.9.  This is consistent with her 
baseline. 

# Hypertension: Patient's aldactone was held given diuresis and 
relatively low BPs on the floor.  Because she was started on 
metoprolol, her aldactone was discontinued.  

# Depression/anxiety:  The patient was continued on her home 
doses of sertraline 200 mg daily and diazepam 5 mg q6 prn.

Labs/Studies Pending at Discharge:
- CTA final read (___)

Transitional Care Issues:
- Patient will need electrolytes checked on ___.  
___ has been arranged and PCP ___.
-Aldactone was held during admission. ___ be resumed outpatient 
if patient tolerates metoprolol.
-Started metoprolol 12.5mg succinate daily. Reccomend continued 
monitoring outpatient as she might benefit from higher dose.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath. We 
believe this was most likely due to extra fluid in your lungs. 
When you first arrived to our Emergency Department, a tube was 
placed in your throat to help you breathe (intubation).  You 
were admitted to the intensive care unit, where you were given a 
medication (Lasix) to help decrease the fluid in your lungs.  
You were treated with steroids to decrease possible inflammation 
in your lungs.  You also received antibiotics to cover the 
bacteria that cause lung infections. You responded well to these 
treatments and your breathing tube was eventually removed.

In the ICU, you had an ultrasound of your heart (Echo) which 
showed slightly worsened disease of one of your heart valves 
(from rheumatic heart disease).  Your heart function is 
otherwise unchanged from your last echo in ___.  

You were then transferred to the medicine floor, where you 
completed the course of antibiotics. You were continued on 
steroids.  Your IV Lasix was transitioned to Lasix by mouth, and 
you continued to put out a considerable amount of extra fluid 
which helped your oxygenation.  Your oxygen requirements 
decreased to your home oxygen of 6 Liters.  You were able to 
ambulate on your own without issue. You will go home on lasix 
60mg daily. This dose might be lowered to 40mg daily after you 
see your primary care doctor next week if she feels it is 
appropriate.

Your sugars were found to be elevated, especially after starting 
prednisone. We had diabetes specialists see you who helped to 
titrate your insulin. You will go home on Insulin Sliding Scale 
regimen that was reviewed with you in the hospital. Please 
follow the attached Sliding Scale regimen.

On the day of discharge you had some chest pain with breathing.  
We obtained a CT scan of your lungs and it showed there is no 
clot in your lungs, this is good news.

Remember to check daily weights. If your weight goes up by 3 
pounds, please call Dr ___ might need a higher dose of 
your lasix. This is VERY important. If you can not get through 
to Dr ___ call your primary care doctor.

The following changes were made to your medications:
STOP Metformin. Do not take this medication any more. It should 
not be taken by patients with heart failure.
STOP Aldactone. You may resume this if your PCP agrees and if 
your blood pressure tolerates. We started you on metoprolol and 
decided to stop the aldactone for now.
START insulin sliding scale with Novolog, see the attached form 
for an explanation.
CHANGED lantus from 20->24 U every evening
START: Bactrim, take 1 tab daily to prevent pneumonia while on 
steroids.
START: Pantoprazole 40mg daily, take this while on steroids
START Prednisone 40 mg daily.  You will be on this medication 
until further discussion with your pulmonologist Dr. ___.   
START Metoprolol 12.5mg daily. Please take ___ pill of the 25mg 
daily. This will protect your heart from future heart failure 
episodes.
CONTINUE: Lasix 60mg daily to help remove fluid from your lungs

No other medication changes were made.  Please continue to take 
them as you have been doing.

Follow-up appointments have been made for you.  Please see the 
details below.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with history of advanced 
interstitial lung disease, likely NSIP, chronic diastolic CHF, 
DM, and chronic pain s/p MVA who initially presented to ___ 
___ on ___ with worsening shortness of breath. Of 
note, she was recently admitted to ___ with respiratory 
failure from ___. During that admission, her 
respiratory failure was felt to be secondary to diastolic CHF, 
HCAP and possibly an ILD flare. She was treated with steroids, 
diuresis and antibiotics. In follow up conversation with her 
pulmonologist, he seemed to think that her respiratory failure 
was more related to her mitral stenosis and recommended tapering 
off steroids in the next ___s a follow up TEE and 
heart cath.  
.  
Per the patient, since d/c from ___, she has had worsening 
shortness of breath and ""bloating."" She also had been 
experiencing high fevers at home, up to 105. She attributes some 
of these symptoms to the steroids and reports that she had some 
improvement after tapering off of the steroids. However, she did 
continue to feel bad and ultimately presented to ___ 
yesterday for evaluation. She also endorses exertional chest 
pain, which she describes as electric-shocklike, located in the 
central and left chest. She also bas been having panic attacks, 
with shortness of breath and heart palpitations. She also has 
had a dry cough recently, which improves with albuterol.  
.  
While at ___, she was seen by the cardiology and 
pulmonary consult services. Labs were significant for a WBC of 
12.4 which improved to 6.6. She underwent a CXR, which shoed 
pulmonary congestion with confluent densities (greater on R), ? 
infiltrates vs. edema. CT chest was also performed, which showed 
""complex scan with acute and chronic lung disease, increased 
infiltration could be due to infection and CHF mediastinal hilar 
adenopathy."" ABG was performed on ___ on 15LPM NRB and 
showed pO2 65, pCO2 41, pH 7.42. She was treated with 
levofloxacin, nebs, and IV lasix. She requested transfer to 
___ given that her providers are primarily located here.  
.  
On arrival to the floor, patient's VS were T=99.5 BP=110/73 
HR=90 RR=20 O2 sat=95%/5L.  
.  
Review of systems was generally pan-positive. She endorsed 
chornic back pain as well as the above symptoms listed in the 
HPI. She denied any N/V/D/C or urinary symptoms.  

 
Past Medical History:
# Non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (possibly idiopathic

C-cath ___
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system 
revealed 
no significant coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and 
RCA 
were all normal without angiographically apparent flow limited 
disease. 
The LCx had a large ramus branch. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right 
sided 
filling pressures with mean PCWP 29mmHg and RVEDP 15mmHg.  There 
was 
severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 69 mmHg. 
Central aortic 
pressures were normal at 137/80 with a mean of 97 mmHg. 
3. The mean mitral valve gradient was 13.5 mmHg and calculated 
MVA 1.23 
cm2 with excellent hemodynamic tracings, oxygen saturation 
confirmed 
PCWP and reversed transducers.  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. 
2. Moderate mitral stenosis with valve area 1.23 cm2, mean 
transmitral 
pressure gradient 13.4 mmHg. 
3. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction. 
4. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
. 
TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and 
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve 
shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is moderate 
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality (body habitus). 
Characteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve with 
elevated transvalvular gradient suggestive of moderate mitral 
stenosis. However, visually the mitral valve appears more 
pliable. This elevated gradient may be due to an underestimate 
of the severity of mitral regurgitation in the setting of 
moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets and chordal 
structures. Alternatively, it may be that the subvalvular 
structures are more thickened/deformed and adversely affecting 
the effective mitral valve orifice than is able to be 
appreciated on transthoracic imaging. 
Given the internal inconsistencies on the current study, a 
transesophageal echo for further characterization of the mitral 
valve apparatus is recommended.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
severity of mitral stenosis is qualitatively similar but the 
mitral valve area has decreased from 1.8 cm2 to 1.3 cm2 on the 
current study. The severity of pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension has markedly decreased and the right ventricular 
function has improved.  
.   
TEE ___ (preliminary)
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of 
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The ascending, 
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter 
and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 33 cm from the incisors 
(the probe was not advanced past the GE junction due to hiatal 
hernia). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are 
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.The mitral valve 
shows characteristic rheumatic deformity with bowing of the 
anterior leaflet and tethering of the posterior leaflet motion. 
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is 
severe valvular mitral stenosis (mean gradient 15mm Hg). Mild to 
moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve with severe 
mitral stenosis. Mild ot moderate mitral regurgitation. 
Preserved global LV systolic function.
.  
TTE ___ 
Limited and focused imaging. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
.  
TTE ___
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve shows 
characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is severe valvular 
mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion. Severe rheumatic mitral 
stenosis. Grossly-preserved biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
findings are similar. Both studies were focused on excluding 
pericardial effusion. 

TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 11:06:59 AM      FINAL 
The left atrium is elongated. A small atrial septal defect is 
suggested (clip 76) but could not be confirmed. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal 
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.9cm2). 
An eccentric jet of mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation 
is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be 
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 


Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
(pervalvuloplasty), the severity of mitral stenosis is markedly 
reduced and the mitral leaflets are more mobile.  
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the cardiology service. Her CXR on 
admission showed likely worsening pulmonary edema on a 
background of ILD. Given lack of focal infiltrate, leucocytosis, 
and fever, abx were stopped. Steroids or other immunsupression 
were held at the recommendation of her primary pulmonologist. 
She was diuresed with IV lasix. Right and left heart cath was 
done and showed no obstructive CAD, elevated PCWP, and MVA 
1.23cm2. Repeat TTE showed normal EF and moderate mitral 
stenosis, but was a limited study given body habitus. It was 
felt that she may benefit from mitral valuloplasty as mitral 
stenosis was the best explanation for her recurrent CHF and 
elevated wedge pressures. During her time on the cardiology 
floor, she was satting high ___ on ___, which the patient uses 
at home, and appeared to be breathing comfortably. TEE was done 
to look for evidence of thrombus. In the cath lab on ___ 
while attepmting valvuloplasty, when crossing the wire 
transeptally, there was entry into the aorta. The case was 
aborted, and the patient was transferred to the CCU for closer 
monitoring.    
. 
The patient had a TTE post-procedure that showed no pericardial 
effusion or changes in the aorta.  She remained hemodynamically 
stable overnight in the CCU.  She continued to be diuresed with 
lasix.  Her insulin sliding scale was uptitrated for 
hyperglycemia.  The arterial and venous sheaths were removed 
from her groin the following day.  Repeat TTE demonstrated no 
interval changes with no pericardial effusions.  She was called 
back out to the cardiology floor. CXR Pa/Lat was ordered for AM 
after call-out both to assess fluid status and to better 
evaluate possibility of underlying infectious process. Repeat 
CXR was much improved without pulmonary edema. Decision was made 
to take pt back for valvuloplasty on ___. Procedure was 
successful and without complication; gradient improved (see ECHO 
and procedure report for full details). Pt's clinical status was 
monitored for an additional day and lasix was titrated. She was 
d/c'ed home with ___ and planned outpt follow-up with cardiology 
and pulm.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,
Thank you for coming to ___ 
your care. You were transferred here from ___, where 
___ were admitted with shortness of breath. Your symptoms were 
felt to be due to fluid in the lungs. We gave you a medicine 
called Lasix (furosamide) to help get rid of the fluid. We 
thought the cause for the fluid was your tight mitral valve. We 
did a few tests to better asses the tightness of your valve, and 
we thought you would benefit from a procedure called 
valuloplasty or ballooning to open up the valve more. The first 
attempt was complicated by ___ in the aorta and was 
unsuccessful; the second attempt was successful and your valve 
was successfully dilated. You were able to be discharged home 
with follow-up planned as an outpatient.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
- Please DECREASE your lasix dose to 40mg daily
- Please INCREASE your Metoprolol XL dose from 12.5 daily to 25 
mg daily
- Please STOP taking valsartan. Instead, please START taking 
losartan 25mg daily. Please speak to your doctor regarding this 
change.
- You reported that you were no longer taking Sertraline 
(Zoloft) so we have taken this off your medication list; we 
encourage you to speak with your doctor(s) if you experience any 
symptoms of depression.
- We also STOPPED/did NOT continue the Prednisone and 
Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Bactrim) that is listed on your 
medication list as this was not thought to be helping your lung 
problem
- Please use saline nasal spray and fluticasone spray for your 
nose as needed
- Please use miconazole nitrate poweder for red itchy skin as 
needed
- We are leaving Lantus at 24 units as we discussed because you 
felt this was safer for your sugars; but as we also discussed, 
you will need to closely monitor your sugars. 

Please be sure to take all medication as prescribed.
.
Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.
.
Please be sure to keep all follow-up appointments with your PCP, 
cardiologist and other health care providers.
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you a speedy 
recovery.

on insulin and obesity, who presented to OSH on ___ with 
anasarca and concern of groin infection, transferred to ___ 
___ for management of suspected right heart failure. She was 
diuresed with a lasix drip transitioned to bolus and then oral. 
She was treated for groin cellulitis and candidal intertrigo. 

Active issues:

# Right-sided heart failure
Patient was continued on a IV lasix drip from OSH upon transfer 
to ___. Cardiology was consulted and an ECHO study here showed 
moderate pulmonary hypertension and mild mitral valve stenosis, 
consistent with right-sided heart failure leading to lower 
extremity swelling. She remained on a IV lasix gtt with brisk 
diuresis to goal negative 2L/day, then was transitioned to IV 
lasix BID with continued diuresis to goal and significant 
improvement in lower extremity edema. After swelling resolved, 
she was put on a home maintenance dose of lasix 40mg PO BID. She 
will follow-up with cardiolgy as an outpatient. Weight upon 
discharge was 97.2kg.   

# Groin cellulitis and candidal intertrigo
Per PCP, patient developed infection of her perineum/groin after 
spraying herself with insecticide. The patient noted that she 
thought someone had brought lice inter her house so she used 
""lice spray"" over her body. She was started on clindamycin and 
fluconazole for cellulitis and candidal intertrigo at the 
outside hospital, and completed a total 7-day course here with 
complete resolution of the infection. She has residual 
intertrigo but no evidence of superinfection. 

# Lower extremity venous stasis 
Patient presented with dark reddish-purple discoloration in her 
lower extremities bilaterally. This was consistent with venous 
stasis changes. Her feet were also cool to touch but she had 
dopplerable pulses bilaterally throughout hospital course. With 
diuresis the color did improve slightly. However, it is 
recommended that she have bilateral ABIs as an outpatient to 
asses lower extremity arterial flow. 

# Skin excoriations
The patient presented with multiple skin excoriations of unknown 
etiology for which she was provided daily wound care with marked 
improvement of the skin lesions.

# Anxiety/hallucinations
Per PCP, patient developed the skin infection after spraying 
herself with insecticide as she thought that bugs were crawling 
out of her skin. Per patient, her family member had brought lice 
into the home and she sprayed herself with lice spray to treat 
it. Patient was reportedly very anxious at OSH regarding ""bugs 
crawling out of her skin"" and was started on quetiapine prn. She 
did not express this or any other hallucinations following 
admission here. Patient was reportedly taking both diazepam and 
lorazepam at home. Here, her home diazepam was continued but 
lorazepam was held.  Patient's anxiety was well-controlled on 
this for the remainder of her stay. On discharge, mental status 
exam was normal - she was alert and oriented x 3 with no 
auditory or visual hallucinations. She was discharged on her 
home diazepam dose with lorazepam held. 

Chronic issues:

# Interstitial lung disease
Patient was breathing comfortably and saturating > 94% on her 
home oxygen requirement (4L NC and 50% ventimask) throughout 
hospitalization.

# DM
Hypoglycemic on admission to OSH and home lantus was held. Here, 
it was restarted and blood sugars remained well-controlled with 
this and humalog sliding scale. Home metformin was held.   

# HTN:
Continued home metoprolol. 

# CAD s/p MI (normal MIBI in ___  
Continued Crestor

# Chronic pain:  
Continued home MS contin as well as morphine ___ for breakthrough 
pain. She only requested 2 doses of morphine ___ throughout 
hospital course, so this was discontinued on discharge.

# Migraines
Controlled with acetaminophen prn.

# GERD
Controlled with Zantac prn.

Transitional issues:
- She was discharged on furosemide 40mg PO BID as maintenance to 
keep her euvolemic. Her weight on discharge was 97.2kg. She has 
a follow-up appointment with Cardiology for continued 
management. ___ will continue to weigh the patient at home to 
monitor for any gain of weight.
- Patient's feet were dark purple and cool to touch but she had 
dopplerable pulses ___. Recommend ABIs as an oupatient to assess 
for peripheral arterial disease.
- Patient presented with multiple skin excoriations of unknown 
etiology for which she was provided daily wound care with marked 
resolution of the skin lesions. She is set up with home services 
to provide her continued wound care.
- At OSH and on admission, patient was reporting that ""bugs were 
crawling out of her skin."" She did not express these thoughts or 
any other hallucinations thereafter. Her anxiety was 
well-controlled with diazepam 2.5 mg PO Q8H:PRN anxiety but we 
discharged her on her home dose of 5mg and continued to hold her 
home lorazepam. Would titrate as needed.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were transferred to ___ from ___ for 
further management of your swollen legs and a skin infection. We 
did an ultrasound study of your heart, which showed evidence of 
right-sided heart failure. This caused fluid to back up and 
accumulate in your legs. We started you on high dose furosemide 
and successfully removed the extra fluid. You will go home on 
oral furosemide that should keep your fluid level even. Please 
weigh yourself every morning and call the doctor if your weight 
goes up more than 3 lbs, as this may indicate that excess fluid 
is building up again. We have also arranged an appointment for 
you to see a cardiologist.

While here, you were also treated with antibiotics and 
antifungal medication for a skin infection. The infection 
resolved with treatment. Please refrain from applying any sort 
of chemicals or irritants to your skin. 

A physical therapist will come to your home and work with you to 
improve your mobility. A nurse ___ also visit you at home to 
provide care to your skin and to assess your weight.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was transferred to ___ for neurosurgical 
evaluation.  She was admitted to the Neurosurgical ICU and a 
right frontal EVD was placed. A CTA was done that showed no 
evidence of a vascular lesion. She remained stable overnight 
into ___.

On morning rounds on ___ she was noted to be following commands 
with all 4 extremities, as well as opening her eyes to voice. 
Her ICPs remained less than 20, her EVD remained at 15, and she 
was awaiting an MRI for prognostication. Her son was consented 
for a diagnostic cerebral angiogram and she was pre-oped for it 
with plan for it to be done on ___. Later in the day she had a 
loss of 25cc of CSF during positioning for a procedure which was 
aborted and EVD leveled appropriately. Later on she was noticed 
to have horizontal nystagmus and some LUE twitching. She 
received ativan with good effect. Neurology was consulted and 
EEG was started. Her keppra was increased to 1000mg BID. She was 
noted to be posturing intermittently and a STAT CT was obtained 
which was stable. Later in the evening her exam improved and she 
was localizing with her uppers and withdrawing her lowers. 

On ___ she was awaiting MRI and angiogram. Her exam remained 
stable and per neurology her Keppra was increased to 1500mg BID. 
 

On ___, she was unchanged on exam. She awaits angiogram.

On ___, she was stable.

On ___, she was taken to angiogram for partial embolization of 
the posterior meningeal branch. Post operatively, she was not 
moving her BUE to noxious, BLE w/d to noxious and EO to stimuli. 
Her EVD remains at 15.

On ___, on examination, patient spontaneous with LUE and 
extending RUE. BLE w/d briskly to noxious stimuli. She was made 
NPO in preparation for angiogram on ___. EVD was raised to 20 
in attempts to wean. 

On ___, the patient was febrile, cultures were sent and patient 
was given Tylenol. CSF was also sent and showed no growth at 
this time. Her exam was poor and EVD output was very low, a stat 
head CT was done which showed that the EVD catheter was placed 
in the correct position and the IVH was redistributed. A clamp 
trial was attempted and her ICP elevated to 38 and drain was 
opened. No output was seen from the EVD and the EVD was 
replaced. Repeat head CT showed good position of EVD.

On ___, the patient's examination improved. Her EVD was left 
open at 20 and ICPs were within the normal range. The EVD 
drained briskly throughout the day. She will undergo an 
angiogram tomorrow. She was extubated in the afternoon but 
became stridorous and required re-intubation. 

On ___, the patient's neurologic examination remained stable. 
She spiked fevers to 102 overnight. Her EVD remained open at 20 
and her ICPs were all within normal limits. Her urine was 
positive for Enterococcus and her antibiotic regimen was changed 
to Ampicillin. She underwent a BAL and the cultures remain 
pending at this time. The patient was taken back to the angio 
suite for further embolization of her Dural AV Fistula and 
collateral vessels were noted. It was determined further 
intervention will be necessary in the near future. 

On ___, the patient was extubated and EVD was clamped. 

On ___, the patients neurologic status has improved, external 
ventricular drain remained clamped. The patient was slightly 
confused, and repeat head CT suggests slightly larger ventricles

On ___, the patient was alert, neurological exam was improved. 
A repeat non contrast head CT was stable. The patient's external 
ventricular drain was removed, and a sample of CSF fluid was 
sent for culture routinely. The patient was mobilized out of bed 
to the chair. The daughters were updated at the bedside by the 
neurosurgical team.

On ___, the patient was alert, eyes open to voice, EOMs grossly 
intact, patient localizes bilateral upper extremities, and 
withdraws BLE to pain, patient non verbal. The patient was 
called out to the step down unit, awaiting a bed. ___/ OT 
evaluated the patient and recommended rehab. Speech therapy 
consult was placed to evaluate the patients swallow mechanism. 
The patient completed a course of ampicillin for UTI today. 
Foley catheter was changed today. 

Mrs. ___ was transferred to the step-down unit on ___.  
Both physical and occupational therapy were consulted and 
recommended discharge to a rehabilitation facility.  The patient 
was found to have a urinary tract infection and was started on a 
course of ampicillin.  Her Foley catheter was changed.

Between ___ and ___, Mrs. ___ continued to recover 
well.  Because the patient was unable to swallow and therefore, 
had a PEG inserted by ACS on ___.  Tube feeds were started the 
following day.

On the early morning of ___, the patient sustained an 
unwitnessed fall out of bed.  A non-contrast head CT was 
obtained and showed no acute intracranial process.  A 
non-contrast C-spine CT was also obtained and showed no acute 
fracture or subluxation.  Incidentally, however, that exam 
showed a concerning lesion in the apex of the left upper lung.  
As a result, a CT torso was obtained to assess for any possible 
metastatic disease.  

Mrs. ___ was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on 
___. She was afebrile, hemodynamically and neurologically 
stable.  Her course of vancomycin used to treat MRSA pneumonia 
was completed (7 day course).  Her CXR showed no infiltrates and 
the patient was afebrile for at least 72 hours.  Per discharge 
instructions, the patient should follow up with Dr. ___ 
service in approximately one month.  At that time, planning will 
be discussed for surgical resection of her dural AV fistula.

admission creatinine of 1.2).  Pt received hemodialysis for 
volume and solute clearance (from ___ to ___.  She 
developed rapid recovery so hemodialysis was discontinued and 
the HD line was pulled on ___.  Creatinine on discharge was 
1.3.  She will need outpatient follow up with nephrology.  

# BACTEREMIA, STREP VIRIDANS
Pt febrile on ___ and found to have strep viridans bacteremia. 
Strep viridans may be a contaminant, however, the patient has a 
reported h/o poor dentition and dental pain and temporarily 
related fever was concerning for true strep viridans bacteremia.

liver which is too small to characterize.  The liver otherwise 
enhances homogeneously without focal lesions or intrahepatic 
biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is unremarkable and the 
portal vein is patent.  The pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands 
are unremarkable.  The kidneys present symmetric nephrograms and 
excretion of contrast with no pelvicaliceal dilation or 
perinephric abnormalities. 
  
The small bowel is fluid-filled with some areas which are mildly 
dilated; 
however, without sharp transition point.  Contrast reaches the 
mid sigmoid colon.  There is no evidence of obstruction.  The 
appendix is visualized and there is no evidence of appendicitis. 
 The intraabdominal vasculature is unremarkable.  There is no

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with PMHx significant for CAD, HTN, HLD, NIDDMII who 
presented after multiple syncopal episodes at home in the 
setting of 10 episodes of diarrhea.  

# AG acidosis: On admission, patient found to have anion gap 15 
in the setting of BS 400s and UA with ketones suggestive of DKA. 
 Although patient does have DM, he is not insulin dependent at 
baseline making him at lower risk of DKA.  His acidosis is 
likely explained by his ___ GI illness with loss of HCO3 in the 
GI tract, but this would not explain the AG.  Alternatively, the 
patient could have had an elevated lactate in the setting of 
hypovolemia with under perfusion as evidenced by his ___ on 
admission which has resolved with intravenous fluids.  Patient 
was briefly on insulin drips.  His Anion gap closed with fluid 
resuscitation.

# Diarrhea: Likely a viral gastroenteritis given acute onset.  
Patient also no PPI as outpatient, raising the risk of C. diff 
which is therefore, also in the ddx. c. diff antigen returned 
negative.  CT abdomen was also normal as well.  Stool culture 
were negative as well. Diarrhea resolved prior to discharge.

# Syncope: Patient wit ___ episodes of syncope at home in the 
setting of diarrhea so most likely etiology is ___ to 
hypovolemic and orthostasis. Without chest pain or palpitations 
changes to suggest ACS or arrhythmia as etiology, which is 
consistent with EKG unchanged from prior and cardiac biomarkers 
negative. No post-ictal symptoms to suggest seizures.   Pt had 
no more episodes of ___ stay after IV 
fluid support.  Pt had no pre-syncope symptoms prior to 
discharge.

# Acute kidney injury: Unclear recent baseline, although most 
recent Cr from ___ in our system 1.1. pateint presented with Cr 
1.5, likely ___ to pre-renal etiology. pt's creatinine improved 
to 1.0 with IV fluids.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with a hx of HTN, HLD, 
Grave's disease, discoid lupus (in remission x ___ years) who 
presents with pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology 
now s/p pericardiocentesis. She was in her usual state of health 
until 3 weeks ago when she experienced 2 days of fever/chills, 
feeling generally unwell after getting a flu shot. She felt 
better on the third day and was doing well until this weekend 
when she experienced similar symptoms, which she took Tylenol 
for. She was also experiencing intermittent palpitations and 
worsening shortness of breath but no chest pain. She expected 
her symptoms to resolve but they did not so she presented to her 
PCP office on ___ and they told her to seek evaluation at 
___ on ___. 

In the ___ she was found to be tachycardic with an irregular 
rhythm, although there was some uncertainty whether this was 
sinus with ectopy vs afib. SBPs were initially 130s-140s. CXR 
showed large cardiac sillhouette and small ___ effusions. CT 
obtained to r/o PE showed 2.2-2.7 cm pericardial effusion. 
Pulsus pardoxus was measured by ___ at 15. Dr ___ 
thoracic surgery was consulted in the ___ and did not feel that 
the patient required emergent pericardiocentesis. The patient 
stayed in the ___ overnight as no tertiary care beds were 
available. O/n the patient received 5 mg IV lopressor her HRs 
trended down slightly and her dyspnea improved somewhat. Stable 
this am on RA.  Bedside ECHO done with 2.1 cm effusion with some 
fibrin noted, EF 70%, PASP 36, some collapse of RA/RV and resp 
variation across the TV.

She was transferred to ___ and underwent successful 
pericardiocentesis with 230cc of fluid drained, pericardial 
drain placed and then transferred to the CCU for further 
management.

On arrival to the CCU, patient states that she is feeling much 
better than before but is having some soreness at the site of 
the drain placement. Otherwise she denies chest pain, current 
shortness of breath, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
leg swelling, dysuria.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
Positive per HPI.  

On further review of systems, denies fevers or chills. Denies 
any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, 
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. 
Denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review 
of systems were negative.

resp variation across the TV.

TTE ___:
Conclusions   
 Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a very 
small circumferential pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with a hx of HTN, HLD, 
Grave's disease, discoid lupus (in remission x ___ years) who 
presented with pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology 
now s/p successful pericardiocentesis with persistent mild sinus 
tachycardia thought secondary to pericardial inflammation. Her 
home losartan was held in the setting of low blood pressure but 
was normotensive at the time of discharge, this should be held 
until recheck at PCP follow up.

#Pericardial effusion now s/p pericardiocentesis - Etiology of 
effusion unclear at this point, multiple studies pending from ___ 
___ as well as ___ at time of discharge. DDx included 
post-viral, which seemed most likely given recent viral symptoms 
but could also be related to other infectious etiologies vs. 
rheumatologic process vs. thyroid dysfunction (although TSH nl) 
given history vs. malignancy. Patient was placed on NC O2 for 
comfort but ambulated with SPO2 92% at discharge.

#Sinus tachycardia - persistent after pericardiocentesis, likely 
due to residual pericardial fluid vs. potentially hypovolemia, 
no other clear signs of infection prior to discharge, improved 
with 500cc of normal saline, but was still persistent at 
discharge.

#Hyponatremia, resolved - mild hyponatremia to 133 at ___ 
___, resolved prior to discharge

#Acute kidney injury, resolved - Cr up to 1.2 at ___ from 
baseline of 1.0, was thought to be pre-renal in the setting of 
near-tamponade and resolved prior to discharge with discharge Cr 
0.6.

#HTN - Held losartan 20mg QD given soft pressures

#HLD -Continued atorvastatin 20mg QHS

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
-Please order transthoracic echo to follow up pericardial 
effusion within 1 week of discharge.
-Follow up RF, ___, EBV, VZV, HIV, ___, ESR from ___.
-Follow up pending pericardial fluid studies.
-Losartan was held at discharge given normotension. Please 
restart at followup if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were experiencing 
palpitations and shortness of breath. You were found to have 
fluid built up around your heart (pericardial effusion), which 
was drained. You were monitored afterwards and did not have 
fluid build up again. You felt much better after the fluid was 
drained and we felt it was safe for you to leave the hospital.

Please continue to take your medications as directed. Your 
losartan was held because your blood pressures were on the low 
side. You should discuss restarting this medication with your 
doctor. You will also have a follow up appointment with 
Cardiology as below.

Please see your doctors as directed.

It was a pleasure taking care of you,

History of Present Illness:
 ___  year old female with a past medical history of HTN, 
dyslipidemia, abnormal fasting glucose, history of CAD and a 
segment IV liver mass > 6.0 cm with elevated CA ___ > 3000  
initially c/f cholangiocarcinoma but showing poorly 
differentiated adenoCA on pathology. The patient was in the SICU 
from ___ she had segment IV ?cholangiocarcinoma s/p 
chemoembolization by ___ c/b vascular injury to the LHA and 
celiac axis on ___. There was unintentional partial coiling of 
the LHA. Snaring attempts failed to retrieve the coil, resulting 
in the above injuries. At the end of the case a focal celiac 
ostia dissection was ID'd but not treated due to adequate flow 
into the liver and spleen through collaterals. No active 
extravasation was observed.  

She originally p/w several months of constipation and eventual 
LUQ pain for which she sought a colonoscopy and CT. The 
colonoscopy, while poorly prepped, was unrevealing, while the CT 
demonstrated a 6.0 x 7.3 cm segment IV liver mass that was 
difficult to separate from a thickened gallbladder fundus, a few 
subcentimeter hypodensities in the left lobe, as well as an 
increased number of porta hepatis lymph nodes, the largest being 
an 11mm caval lymph node. An ultrasound performed ___ measured 
the lesion at 8.8 x 6.3 and noted the adjacent GB wall 
thickening. A follow-up PET scan ___ noted increased 
radiouptake within the liver as well as a reported right iliac 
bone concerning for metastatic malignancy. Path biopsy on ___ 
was consistent with adenocarcinoma. 
 
In the SICU on ___, pt had pain and nausea; Ondansetron 
increased to q6 hours, IV dilaudid added for pain. She was 
transferred to ___ on ___ where her hospital course 
was complicated by persistent nausea and vomiting, RUQ pain, 
dyspnea, and poor PO intake. On ___ the patient was noted to 
be hypotensive with systolic pressures in the ___ and 
tachycardic to the 120s with an increasing oxygen requirement. 
Labs were significant for wbc 13.4 (from 12.9), lactate 2.5, Na 
132, ALT 260, AST 281, AP 414, Tb .3. ABG was ___. 
She was ordered for a CTA chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bolused 1L 
IVF, started on cipro/flagyl, and transferred to the MICU for 
further management. 
  
On arrival to the MICU, vitals were 98.4, 106/68, 121, 23, 94% 
(4L facemask. The patient reported dyspnea which had improved 
with supplemental oxygen. She denied any nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, chest pain, dysuria, dizziness, other 
complaints.

Studies:
___ ___ ___ VASCULAR EMBOLIZA 
PROCEDURE:  1. Right common femoral artery access. 
2. SMA arteriogram. 
3. Celiac arteriogram. 
4. Cone beam CT right hepatic arteriogram. 
5. Cone beam CT left hepatic arteriogram. 
6. Coil embolization of the right gastric artery. 
7. Amplatzer plug embolization of the left hepatic as well as 
left gastric 
arteries. 
8. Left gastric arteriogram. 
9. Celiac axis arteriogram. 
10. Aortogram. 
11. Right common femoral arteriogram and Angio-Seal closure of 
right common 
femoral artery 
PROCEDURE DETAILS: 
Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives 
to the 
procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the 
patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite 
and placed supine on the exam table.
 
A pre-procedure time-out was performed per ___ protocol. 
Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, the right common 
femoral artery was punctured using a micropuncture set at the 
level of the mid femoral head. A 0.018 wire was passed easily 
into the vessel lumen. A small skin incision was made over the 
needle. Then the inner dilator and wire removed and a 0.035 
___ wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the aorta. The 
micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 5 ___ sheath which 
was attached to a continuous heparinized saline side arm flush. 
A C2 cobra catheter was advanced over ___ wire into the 
aorta. The wire was removed and the SMA was selectively 
cannulated and small contrast injection was made to confirm 
position. SMA arteriogram was performed. The catheter was 
removed and the celiac artery was selectively cannulated and a 
small contrast injection was made to confirm position. A celiac 
arteriogram was performed. This demonstrated a replaced left 
hepatic artery from left gastric artery. To further characterize 
the anatomy, a cone beam CT was performed at the right and left 
hepatic arteries. Attempts to advance the C2 catheter and a 
glidewire into the left gastric artery were unsuccessful. The C2 
catheter was exchanged for ___ 1 glide catheter which was 
eventually advanced into the left gastric artery. Using an STC 
micro catheter and a double angled glidewire, the left hepatic 
artery was selected and an arteriogram was performed. This 
demonstrated branching of the right gastric artery from left 
hepatic artery. The micro wire and catheter were advanced into 
the left hepatic artery and then into the right gastric artery. 
3 x 3 hilum coils were deployed at this location. The first coil 
was deployed within the right gastric artery. The second coiled 
was partially deployed in the right gastric artery and partially 
in the left hepatic artery. 
Further injections of contrast demonstrated diminished flow in 
the left 
hepatic artery and therefore nitroglycerin and heparin were 
injected to 
restore flow. Multiple attempts were made to snare the left 
hepatic artery  oil were unsuccessful. In part, due to unstable 
access at the celiac artery. At that time, the patient was 
uncomfortable on the table due to prolonged procedure time and 
anesthesia was consulted. The patient was intubated and the 
procedure was continued under general anesthesia. 
Subsequently, the existing 5 ___ sheath was exchanged for a 5 
___/ 65 cm sheath which was advanced into the left hepatic 
artery over ___ wire to provide more secure access. More 
attempts were made to snare the coil out were unsuccessful. 
Injection of contrast demonstrated an extraluminal blush 
however, the patient was hemodynamically stable. At that time, 
transplant surgery was consulted and suggested close monitoring 
given the patient's stability. We decided to embolize the left 
gastric artery (trunk that provides supply to the left hepatic 
artery) to prevent potential peritoneal bleeding. A 6mm 
Amplatzer plug was used to embolize the left hepatic artery an 8 
mm Amplatzer plug was used to embolize the left gastric artery 
(trunk). A celiac arteriogram was performed and demonstrated 
occluded left gastric, patent common hepatic and splenic 
arteries but stasis of contrast at the celiac axis suggesting 
focal dissection. There was antegrade flow to the splenic and 
the right hepatic arteries. Attempts to pass a wire into the 
celiac axis to place a stent were unsuccessful. The patient 
remained hemodynamically stable. 
Aortogram was performed to delineate the anatomy. At that time, 
we decided to conclude the procedure and monitor the patient 
clinically. 
A Common femoral arteriogram was performed prior to use of a 
closure device. All catheters and wires were removed and a 6 
___ Angio-Seal device was deployed. Manual pressure was held 
until hemostasis was achieved. The patient tolerated the 
procedure. 
CONE BEAM CT: A rotational angiogram and cone beam CT were 
performed of the right and left hepatic arteries.  Multiplanar 
reformatted images were 
reconstructed, including volume-rendered images, using an 
independent 
workstation and were specifically evaluated and processed by the 
attending physician. These images were essential in 
characterizing the pathology, particularly as the hepatic artery 
and its course could not be clearly characterized on the recent 
CT. 
  
FINDINGS:    
1. Replaced left hepatic artery from left gastric artery. 
2. Right gastric artery arises from a replaced left hepatic 
artery. 
3. Partial embolized left hepatic artery from the right gastric 
artery coil. 
4. Extraluminal contrast extravasation was noted from the left 
hepatic artery  suggestive of a left hepatic artery vascular 
injury. 
5. No further forward flow in the left gastric artery post 
embolization. 
6. Focal stasis of contrast at the celiac axis was noted at the 
end of the procedure. However, there was antegrade flow in the 
splenic and right hepatic arteries. This is suggestive of a 
focal celiac axis dissection. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
1. Incomplete Y 90 planning study. 
2. Embolization of the left hepatic and left gastric arteries to 
manage a left 
hepatic arterial injury. 
3. Focal celiac axis dissection with preserved flow to the 
spleen and the 
right hepatic lobe. 

CXR ___:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
2.  Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions are a 
nonspecific finding. Considering history of clinical suspicion 
for pulmonary embolism, CTA of the chest may be helpful to 
exclude this possibility if warranted clinically. 

CTA Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis ___
1. Limited evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. No 
central pulmonary embolism. 
2. Partial collapse of the bilateral lower lobes. Nodular 
opacity in the left lower lobe superior segment, right upper 
lobe and lingula may represent aspiration or atelectasis, new 
from ___. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 
3. Heterogeneous enhancement of the liver may represent a 
combination of tumor and differential perfusion after 
embolization of the right gastric artery, left gastric artery 
and left hepatic artery. No evidence of active extravasation. 
Nonhemorrhagic perihepatic ascites is new from ___. 
4. Known celiac artery dissection (2a: 113). 
5. Fluid within the mid and lower esophagus puts the patient at 
risk for aspiration. 
 
___ Imaging PORTABLE ABDOMEN 
IMPRESSION:  
Mild gaseous dilatation of small bowel with gas throughout the 
large bowel, most compatible with ileus. 

___ Imaging ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT 
IMPRESSION:  
Multiple dilated loops of small bowel, similar to prior, with 
suggestion of bowel wall thickening

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with a past medical history of HTN, 
dyslipidemia, abnormal fasting glucose, history of CAD and 
metastatoc cholangiocarcinoma. Hospital course complicated by 
vascular injury during chemoembolization, E.coli urosepsis and 
ileus. Per patient and family's wishes, goals of care was 
transitioned to outpatient/inpatient hospice near patient's 
family. 
  
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Pain s/p chemoembolization c/b vascular injury to the LHA and 
celiac axis on ___. Patient underwent vascular injury during 
Y-___ planning study for chemoembolization of metastatic 
cholangiocarcinoma. This resulted in celiac artery dissection 
and embolization of left gastric artery. The ___ hospital 
course was not complicated by bleeding or inappropriate 
infarction. Interventional radiology followed patinet in house, 
and indicated no need for further ___ intervention. Patient had 
singificant pain ___ the procedure, possibly capsular pain. 
Patient was kept on tyelnol and anti emetics while in house. 
Pain well controlled with IV APAP 4 gm.

# SIRS/Urosepsis and Bacteremia: The patient was transferred to 
MICU on ___ for new onset tachycardia, hypotension, and new 
oxygen requirement. There was concern for possible bleed given 
patient's procedure history, however, CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis 
showed no active extravasation, also H/H stable. PE was ruled 
out with CTA, although CTA chest showed RUL consolidation 
concerning for aspiration. Urine culture revealed pansensitive 
E.coli; Blood cultures also grew out pansensitive E.coli. She 
was empirically started on vanc/cipro/flagyl, narrowed to 
levaquin monotherapy. Pt will complete a 10 day course.  

#Increasing Leukocytoisis. Patient treated for E. coli 
bacteremia as above, but with persistently uptrending 
leukocytosis upon arrival to floor. Ciprofloxacin switched to 
levofloxacin on the floor to cover for PNA as well as UTI. Due 
to increasing leukocytosis (but without fever), vancomycin and 
flagyl were re-added, however WBCs ___ despite these 
interventions. Decision made to suspend vancomycin and flagyl so 
as to reculture. These results were negative at time of 
discharge

# Dyspnea: The ___ hospital course was complicated by 
dyspnea that has worsened since transfer to ET. Given findings 
on CT chest as well as worsening wbc, hypotension and elevated 
lactate there was concern her dyspnea may be due to a pneumonia, 
with particular concern for aspiration. However, radiographic 
findings on CXR were not consistent with PNA, and patient was 
ultimately kept on ciprofloxacin monotherapy for UTI/bacteremia 
as above. Etiology for dyspnea still unknown at time of 
discharge. 

# Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma to bone: Very poor prognosis has 
been relayed to family. Palliative care and radiation oncology 
were consulted in house, and it was noted that radiation would 
only be palliative for symptomatic mets. As patient is currently 
not in pain, also not able ot lie down ___ dyspnea, radiation 
oncology consult deferred. 

#Ileus: ___ hospital course complicated by ileus sustained 
in MICU, most likely secondary to narcotic use v. Y-90 
procedure. KUB ___ c/w ileus, patient with nausea/vomiting 
improved after NG tube placement ___. Patient placed on IV 
reglan and aggressive bowel regimen. Patient give 
methylnaltrexone to reverse effects of narcotics, but to no 
avail.

# CAD, HTN: Patient's home anti-hypertensives were held in the 
setting of hypotension as above.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a lovely ___ with past history of endometrial 
cancer, as well as recent acute onset pain in her knee which has 
been worked up by orthopedics to some extent. This workup has 
revealed a likely bony lesion in her femur, and also new nodules 
in her lungs which are concerning for malignancy. The patient 
presented to our emergency department this morning with sudden 
onset chest pain since 3 AM today. She describes the pain as a 
mild, dull pain in her chest which does not radiate to her arm 
or up her jaw; it is somewhat worse when she takes a deep 
breath. She had some shortness of breath associated with the 
pain and also felt like her heart was racing. She also noted 
some sweating with the pain. She has never had pain like this 
before. 
.
In the ED, her VS were 97.9 114 159/79 22 100% RA. Labs were 
notable for WBC 17.5 (82% PMNs), HCT 35.7, PLT 492. She also had 
a slightly increased AG of 16 with bicarb of 22. A first set of 
troponins was negative. Lactate was 3.0 and the pt was 
hyperglycemic to 238. UA positive for protein, ketones, and 
glucose. A CXR showed no acute intrapulmonary process. Wet read 
of ___ ultrasound showed no DVT. CTA showed no PE but did show 
nodules and lymph nodes suspicious for malignancy. The patient 
was admitted to medicine for pain control and further 
evaluation.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, VS were 99.2 160/88 105 22 100% RA. 
The pt was uncomfortable and in a lot of pain but interactive 
and appropriate. She reports that her chest pain has largely 
resolved, though she continues to have some dyspnea and 
sweating. Her leg pain is excruciating, ___ in severity, and 
she is unable to walk or move the leg at all. Her leg pain has 
been gradually increasing over the past ___ wks, and she notes a 
fist-size hard lump on her R distal thigh. The pain is worst 
over the R medial aspect of her knee. She has been taking 
ibuprofen and oxycodone 15mg Q4H with minimal relief. Her last 
BM was 10d ago.
. 
ROS: She endorses appetite loss, night sweats, and weight loss 
of roughly 5lbs over the past several weeks. She denies HA, 
visual changes, numbness, weakness, tingling, rhinorrhea,

MICROBIOLOGY: 
Urine culture: E. coli pan-sensitive
.
CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
.
CTA: IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism, aortic aneurysm or 
dissection.
2) Lung nodules suspicious for malignancy. Significant bilateral 
hilar
lymphadenopathy also suspect. If not already followed, recommend 
referring
patient for appropriate consultation.
.
R ___: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
R KNEE and FEMUR XRAY: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of 
___, there is little overallchange. Though there is some patchy 
osteopenia especially distally, this again is nonspecific, 
though it could be related to osseous metastasis. This region is 
distinct from the focal area of signal abnormalities seen in the 
distal femur anteriorly on the outside MRI (not definitely 
appreciated on this study).
.
R THIGH MRI: 
1. Diffuse infiltrative heterogeneous-appearing mass 
incompletely seen 
involving the diaphysis of the mid to distal femur with a large 
extraosseous soft tissue component deep to the vastus 
musculature with likely involvement of the vastus intermedius 
muscle and edematous changes in the remaining vastus 
musculature. Findings in the femur are detailed above highly 
concerning for metastatic disease given history of endometrial 
cancer versus less likely, but still possible, a primary 
malignant osseous neoplasm or lymphoma given permeative 
appearance on radiographs from ___. There is concern for 
intraarticular extension into the knee joint space 
anteromedially with 
disruption of cortex signal with also possible neoplastic 
involvement in the posterolateral knee joint space, detailed 
above. These findings have 
progressed in comparison to recent prior outside knee MRI from 
___. 
2. Moderate knee joint effusion. 
3. Fatty atrophy of the posterior and posteromedial compartment 
thigh 
musculature. 
4. Multifocal osseous involvement of the medial and lateral 
femoral condyles, likely also representing osseous metastatic 
disease. 
.
CT-GUIDED R THIGH BIOPSY:
IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided biopsy of right femur mass and 
corresponding large anterior soft tissue component, as described 
above. The core biopsy specimens were sent to pathology and the 
cytology and RPMI specimen were also carried to cytology and 
pathology laboratory as separate specimens 
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS: ___
1. Multiple ill-defined hypoenhancing areas in both kidneys are, 
given the history of malignancy, concerning for renal 
metastases. 
2. Subcentimeter pulmonary nodules in both lower lobes as 
described. 
3. Left adnexal structure as described. This may be better 
characterized 
with ultrasound to confirm or exclude ovarian tissue. 
4. Right adrenal nodule. 
.
TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) RIGHT:
No oblique view or localizing history is available. Allowing for 
this, no 
lytic or sclerotic lesion is detected in the right lower leg. AP 
view shows some bony prominence along the lateral aspect of the 
proximal tibial metadiaphysis, difficult to evaluate on this 
view. There is no corresponding finding on knee radiographs 
dated ___ and therefore this is likely artifactual. If this 
orresponds t the area of clinical interest, then further 
assessment with AP, oblique, and lateral radiographs of the knee 
would be recommended. At the edge of these films, a known area 
of lucency in the distal femur is suggested. 
.
PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:
Fullness in the right paratracheal area is unchanged over 
previous 
examinations and was shown to be due to benign fat deposition on 
chest CTA ___, however the left hilar mass is still 
present. Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion. Heart 
size normal. 
.
VENOUS DUP EXT BILATERAL:
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Multiple prominent right 
inguinal lymph 
nodes are present, the largest measuring 9 mm with diffusely 
abnormal 
echogenicity. There is normal compressibility, flow, and 
augmentation in the bilateral common femoral and right 
superficial and deep femoral, greater saphenous, and popliteal 
veins. Calf veins were not well visualized. Diffuse subcutaneous 
edema is present. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No right lower extremity DVT above the knee. 
2. Diffuse subcutaneous edema.
.
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: 
Grayscale and Doppler sonogram of the right common femoral, 
right superficial femoral and right popliteal veins showed 
normal compressibility, flow and augmentation. Calf veins are 
not well visualized on this study. Extensive subcutaneous edema 
is noted diffusely; however, there is more focal illdefined 
area of fluid ranging over approximately 3 cm extending along 
the anterior aspect of the femur within the right mid-lower 
thigh region. Multiple inguinal lymph nodes are noted within the 
right groin, the largest measures 3.1 x 0.7 cm. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of DVT in right common femoral, superficial 
femoral and 
popliteal veins. Calf veins could not be visualized on today's 
study. 
2. Diffuse subcutaneous edema, however, there is more focal 
ill-defined area of fluid ranging over approximately 3 cm 
extending along the anterior aspect of the femur within the 
right mid-lower thigh region.  

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of Grade IA endometrial cancer status post 
hysterectomy in ___ presents with worsening R leg pain with 
radiographic evidence of bony lesion and possible metastasis to 
lung.  
.
#Chest pain/dyspnea: The patient initially presented to with 
sudden onset chest pain that may have had a pleuritic component 
and was associated with dyspnea and diaphoresis. Given her 
history of endometrial cancer and likely recurrence of 
malignancy, her unilateral leg pain and swelling, and the sudden 
onset pleuritic nature of her pain, pulmonary embolism was 
considered, but ruled out by normal CTA. Lower extremity 
ultrasound showed no deep vein thrombosis on the right leg. 
Myocardial infarction was ruled out. Other etiologies considered 
included anxiety due to leg pain and metastasis to bones in the 
chest (though this is unlikely to present with sudden-onset 
pain). Her chest pain and dyspnea improved as her pain 
controlled was optimized.
.
# Constipation: On admission the patient reported that she had 
not had a bowel movement in over ten days, likely secondary to 
opioid pain management. She was maintained on an aggressive 
bowel regimen while in ___.
.
# Right femur lesion: Patient was found to have a mass in her 
right femur. Orthopaedics was consulted, and the decision was 
made to take the patient to the operating room for an open 
reduction, internal fixation of the right femur. The anterior 
cortex was noted to be breeched. Pathology was sent which showed 
high-grade carcionoma. This area caused the patient to have 
significant pain. Radiation oncology as consulted to help with 
pain management. The patient received a total of 5 radiation 
treatments for a total of ___ Gy. Palliative care was also 
consulted to help with pain control. The patient was 
transitioned from a dilaudid PCA to methadone 10mg three times 
daily and oral dilaudid for control of the patient's pain. She 
was continued on Lovenox 40mg sub-cutaneously after surgery for 
DVT prophylaxis. 
.
# Pain Control: Pain control was an active issue though this 
hospitalization. The patient was initially started on oxycontin 
twice daily dosing with the dosing increased according to the 
patient's PRN use oxycodone. The patient was eventually 
transitioned to a dialudid PCA for beakthrough pain. Palliative 
care was consulted to help manage the patient's pain control. 
Per Palliative care recs, the patient was started methadone 5mg 
three times daily. The patient's initial dose was reduced in the 
setting of fluconazole which can increase the dose of methadone 
given that it inhibits the ___ system. Lidocaine patches were 
started ___. With stabilization of the patient's pain on 5mg of 
methadone three times daily, the patient was transitioned from a 
dialudid PCA to oral dialudid as needed for breakthrough pain 
___. The patient's methadone was increased to 10mg three 
times daily after completion of a full course of fluconazole on 
___. EKG after this dose adjustment showed a QTc that was 
within normal limits. The patient is being discharged on a 
stable pain regimen as follows: methadone 10mg three times daily 
and dilaudid by mouth ___ every 2 hours for breakthrough pain. 
 
.
#Viral upper respiratory tract infection: Through the admission, 
the patient acutely developed hoarseness. She was given cepachol 
lozenges as needed for comfort. The patient's symptoms resolved. 

.
#Leukocytosis: Throughout the patient's admission, she had a 
leukocytosis. Intially, this was attributed to an E. coli 
urinary tract infection. The leukocytosis was also thought to 
represent a stress reaction given the patient's surgery and pain 
secondary to the surgery and bone leision. The patient received 
a dose of dexamethasone with chemotherapy that was administered 
on ___. The patient's white blood cell count trended downward, 
but remained high on day of discharge.
.
# Anemia: Patient was hemodynamically stable through the 
admission, though hematocrit fell (most likely due to dose of 
carboplatin received ___. The patient received 2 units of 
pRBCs during the admission. Her hematocrit remained stable after 
tranfusion.  
.
# Cancer of unknown primary: Pathology shows a poorly 
differentiated carcinoma, though no clear source, possible from 
prior endometrial CA. Patient received 1 dose of carboplatin 
___ and tolerated the infusion without symptoms of nausea and 
vomiting. The patient will need to follow-up with Dr. ___ 
in clinic as an outpatient. 
.
# Oral ___: The patient developed extensive thrush that 
involved her posterior oropharynx. The patient also complained 
of odynophagia, dysphagia, and hoarseness. ENT scoped the 
patient and did not see involvement of the patient's vocal cords 
with thrush. GI was also consulted and did not feel that EGD 
would be necessary as this would not change the management of 
the patient. She was started on a 14 day course of fluconazole 
for oral thrush and presumed candidal esophagitis given her 
history of odynophagia. The patient was also on Nystatin swish 
and swallow four-times-daily. ___ improved through her 
hospital course. On day of discharge, there was no thrush 
appreciated in the oropharyxn, and the patient had no complaints 
of odynophagia.  
.
# Hypercalcemia of malignancy: The patieint initially presented 
with an elevated calcium. she was given pamidronate on ___ 
and treated with IV fluids. The patient's calcium improved. On 
day of discharge, the patient's calcium was 9.8.
.
# E. coli UTI: Curing the hospitalization, the patinet developed 
a urinary tract infection. The patient completed ciprofloxacin 
course. Repeat urine culture showed <10,000 organisms/mL. 
Patient had a Foley in place during much of her admission 
secondary to difficulty moving and her sacral decubitus ulcer. 
On day of discharge, the patient had been without a Foley 
catheter for 2 days. 
.
# Facial Pains: Through the admission, the patient developed 
facial pain that she described as burning, episodic pains 
triggered by stress. These episodes lasts for approxmiately 30 
seconds and then resolve. The patient was started on gabapentin 
600mg PO daily for these facial pains. On day of discharge, the 
patient denied having any of these facial pains. 
.
#DM: The patient's home metformin and glipizide were 
discontinued during this admission. She was started on an 
insulin sliding scale. finger stick blood glucose measurements 
were monitored through the admission. The patient was 
transitioned to glargine and as insulin sliding scale. On day of 
discharge, the patinet's fingerstick blood glucose measurements 
ranged from 97-206 She is being discharged to rehab on 14 units 
of glargine insulin in the morning and a regular insulin sliding 
scale.  
.
#HTN: Patient was admitted with a known history of hypertension. 
The patient's blood pressure medications required titration. 
During the admission, her lisinopril was increased to 40mg 
daily, and the patient was started on chlorthalodone. Despite 
this blood pressure regimen, the patient would have episodes of 
systolic blood pressures in the 180s (the patient was 
asymptomatic during these episodes) for which she recieved IV 
hydralazine. However, as the patient's pain became better 
controlled, the patient had systolic blood pressures as low as 
the ___. The patient was bolused and her blood pressure 
medication was discontinued. The patient's blood pressures were 
elevated in the 130-150s after stopping her regimen. She was 
restarted on lisinopril 40mg daily and chlorthaladone 12.5mg 
daily. 
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of your during your 
hospitalization at ___.

During this admission, you were found to have a mass in your 
right femur bone that was concerning for cancer. You underwent 
imaging tests and had biopsies done that returned highly 
suggestive of cancer. The Orthopaedics team took you to the 
operating room for a procedure to help with pain reduction in 
the right knee. Radiation oncology also saw you through the 
admission and gave you 5 treatments of radiation therapy to the 
right knee to help with pain control.

Pain control was an on-going issue for you during this 
admission. We have adjusted your pain medication regimen so that 
you are now taking 10mg of methadone three times daily with oral 
dilaudid for breakthrough pain. Lidocaine patches as well as 
scheduled acetaminophen and ibuprofen were started during this 
admission to help with pain control.

During this admission, you also received one (1) dose of 
chemotherapy known as carboplatin. You tolerated the 
chemotherapy well with no side effects of nausea or vomitting. 

Your blood pressure medication regimen was modified during this 
admission. Your oral diabetes medications were discontnued 
during this admission, and you have been transtitioned to 
insulin for control of your blood sugars.

Please take all medications as prescribed.

EEG:
This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG study because of 
diffusely suppressed and slow background indicative of a 
moderate to severe encephalopathy. The frontally predominant 
delta frequency activity can be seen in toxic/metolic 
disturbances, but may also be seen in midline or subcortical 
dysfunction, including hydrocephalus. Thus, clinical correlation 
is recommended. No epileptiform discharges or electrographic 
seizures were present in the record. A note was made of sinus 
tachycardia and occasional premature wide complex beats.
.
CT head:
IMPRESSION: Multiple hyperdense masses involving both the 
superficial and 
deep white matter and deep gray matter, with an area of 
vasogenic edema in the left occipital lobe. Differential 
diagnosis is broad, though findings are most likely secondary to 
hemorrhagic metastases given the clinical history. Other 
possibilities, though less likely include hemorrhagic infarcts 
secondary to dural venous or cortical venous thrombosis, 
spontaneous hemorrhage from complication of anticoagulation 
(given the recent history of orthopedic surgery), lymphoma or 
infection. Further characterization with MRI of the brain is 
recommended 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs ___ is a ___ y/o f with metastatic poorly differentiated 
carcinoma who was admitted for AMS and new left hemiplegia found 
to be likely d/t newly diagnosed malignant metastases to brain 
(multiple lesions) with hemorrhage into right thalamic lesion. 
After consultation with the oncology team and patient's family 
decision was made to focus care on comfort and patient was 
discharged home with hospice. 

 

ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (AMS)  patient was transientently 
intubatied for airway protection to allow for disgnostic 
testing.  Attributed to multiple brain mets, some with 
complication of bleeding, and surrounding vasogenic edema.  No 
clinical or EEG evidence for active seizures.  Treated with oral 
steroids and prophylactic anti-convulsant.

 

BRAIN LESIONS  Not previously recognized.  Likely metastatic 
disease from her known poorly differentiated CA of uncertain 
primary.  Evidence for hemorrhage into lesions per CT. Per our 
oncology team no further theraputic or palliative 
chemo/radiation can be offered that would be of benefit to the 
patient.  
 

HEMIPLEGIA, LEFT  likely ___ to acute bleed into brain 
mets(consistent with right thalamic lesion and hemmorage seen on 
CT). Repeat Head CT without significant change.  

CARCINOMA  metastatic poorly differentiated, unclear etiology.  
Per oncology team no plans for further chemotherapy.  

 

RIGHT LEG SWELLING  recent orthopedic surgery ORIF.  No further 
interventions with Orthopedic service.  No evidence for DVT by 
___.

 

Goals of care: meeting was held with patient's family, ICU and 
Oncology team, per patient's dire condition and family's wishes 
decision to transition to comfort focused care. Patient was 
followed by palliative care and is now dicharged to out patient 
hospice.

RUQ ULTRASOUND
FINDINGS:  
The liver echotexture is normal. No concerning hepatic mass is 
detected. The main portal vein is patent, demonstrating proper 
hepatopetal flow. There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilation. 
The gallbladder is normal. The CBD is normal in caliber, 
measuring 3 mm. 
  
The pancreas is normal. There is no ascites. Included views of 
the IVC and aorta are within normal limits. The right and left 
kidneys measure 11.3 and 9.3 cm, respectively, without stone, 
mass, or hydronephrosis. The spleen is not enlarged, measuring 
10.5 cm. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Normal ultrasound appearance of the liver, gallbladder, and 
spleen. 

CXR ON ___
IMPRESSION: 
Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Multifocal mainly mid and 
lower lobe opacities are present on both PA and lateral view, 
with some peripheral and basal for disposition. There is no 
appreciable pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. 
  
The findings although potentially representing infectious 
process, can 
represent other etiologies for example cryptogenic organizing 
pneumonia or drug reaction. Giving the patient history, further 
assessment with chest CT is required. There is no pneumothorax. 
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema 

CHEST CT ON ___
IMPRESSION:  
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities predominantly in the lower 
lobes and at the periphery of the lungs, which may be seen with 
multifocal infection, such as a viral infection. In the setting 
of allogeneic bone marrow transplant and minimal patient 
symptoms, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, a diagnosis of 
exclusion, may be most likely in this situation. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
#SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Mr. ___ presented with dyspnea on 
exertion and findings on a CT of the Chest notable for diffuse 
bilateral opacities. Based on the imaging findings and his 
clinical status, the leading differential under consideration 
includes aspergillosis versus an organizing pneumonia, though 
atypical infectious etiologies such as a viral PNA or PCP are 
also being considered. Of note, he had discontinued prophylaxis 
with voriconazole about 3 weeks prior to this admission due to a 
transaminitis. He remained afebrile throughout the admission 
with an ambulatory oxygen saturation of 94%. He underwent a 
bronchoscopy on ___. Due to concern for aspergillosis as 
the cause of his symptoms, an ID Consult was requested. The 
patient had to leave the hospital before the ID recommendations 
could be finalized but their preliminary recommendation was that 
the patient be discharged on voriconazole 450 q12hrs X 1 day 
followed by 350mg q12hrs. They recommended this or another 
acceptable treatment for aspergillosis be continued until there 
is evidence of response or an alterative diagnosis had been 
identified. The biopsy results from his bronchoscopy were 
pending at the time of discharge. The Interventional Pulmonary 
Team recommended that Mr. ___ remain on lifelong prophylaxis 
for aspergillosis regardless of his final diagnosis.

#TRANSAMINITIS: Mr. ___ has had a transaminitis of uncertain 
etiology with an ALT and AST on this admission of 176 and 98, 
respectively. The differential for this problem may include GVHD 
of the liver, drug toxicity second to voriconazole or other 
biliary etiologies. Hepatology was consulted and recommended an 
abdominal ultrasound that showed a normal liver, gallbladder and 
spleen. Iron studies, Hepatitis labs and several Rheumatologic 
labs were ordered on their team's recommendation. Transaminitis 
downtrended without any intervention and on the day of discharge 
ALT was 101, AST was 43 and Alk Phos was 264. The plan was for 
Mr. ___ to follow-up on this problem in the outpatient 
___ clinic.

#MALE BREAST CANCER: Mr. ___ has male breast cancer ___ s/p 
mastectomy with a plan for tamoxifen. This was not started 
during his admission due to transaminitis.

#AML s/p alloBMT (day+261): Mr. ___ is s/p a matched related 
donor alloBMT for AML. While inpatient his Tacrolimus was 
continued at 0.5mg twice weekly (M/Th).  Acyclovir prophylaxis 
was also continued at 400mg q8hrs.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please follow-up bronchoscopy results including final BAL ___, 
galactomannan and Respiratory Viral Antigen Panel as well as 
final pulm tissue pathology
- Follow-up with ___ regarding appropriate 
- Plan to follow-up with Pulmonary regarding final results and 
treatment planning
- Plan to follow-up with Hepatology for further work-up of 
Transaminitis

___ 10:___HEST W/CONTRAST 
IMPRESSION:  
1.  New ground-glass opacities with septal thickening and 
dependent small pleural effusions, most suggestive of 
hydrostatic edema.  Differential agnosis includes atypical 
infection and less likely leukemic nfiltration. 
2. Pre-existing lung nodules are difficult to compare to the 
prior CT due to technical limitations of today's exam.  Consider 
a ___ month followup CT to allow more precise comparison of a 
potentially growing left upper lobe nodule in order to exclude 
the possibility of a slowly growing lesion within the lung 
adenocarcinoma spectrum.

IMPRESSION: 
1. No intra-abdominal infection or hemorrhage is identified. 
2. Splenomegaly (similar to ___ CT)

PATHOLOGY:
==========
___ FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT 
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that a major subset of the 
cells isolated from this peripheral blood are in the CD45 
dim/low side scatter blast"" region. They express CD38, immature 
antigens CD34, ___, nTdT (dim subset ~39%), myeloid 
associated antigens cytoplasmic MPO, CD117 and CD33. They 
co-express CD56. 
They lack B-cell associated antigens (CD19, cCD22, cCD79a), T 
cells (cCD3) associated antigens and are negative for CD13, 
CD14, CD64, CD11b. 
Blast cells comprise 88% of total analyzed events. 
INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute 
myeloid leukemia. 
Correlation with clinical, morphologic (see separate pathology 
report ___ cytogenetic findings is recommended. 

___ HEMATOPATHOLOGY REPORT - Final
DIAGNOSIS:
RELAPSED ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, SEE NOTE.
NOTE: By flow cytometry, blasts comprise >90% of total analyzed 
events and have a myeloid immunophenotype expressing CD38, CD34, 
HLADR, nTdT (subset), CD117, CD33, cyMPO, along with CD56. 
Please correlate with cytogenetics (___-1550) findings. 
Findings discussed at interdepartmental ___ conference on 
___.
ASPIRATE SMEAR:
The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and consists of 
multiple cellular spicules. The cellularity is almost entirely 
comprised of blasts with cytomorphologic features similar to 
those described above. Residual hematopoiesis is extremely 
scant.

tamoxifen, also with a history of intermediate risk AML s/p 
reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplant ___, MRD 
sister) currently in remission who presented with myalgias, 
night sweats, fatigue and leukocytosis concerning for acute 
leukemia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Relapsed acute leukemia: BM Bx ___ consistent with relapse. 
Treated w/ MEC (D1 = ___, no blasts on D23 sustained. 
Sluggish count recovery. Given low counts, repeat BM deferred to 
outpatient setting (f/u apt scheduled ___. 
# Abx: After completing tx for febrile neutropenia (cefepime, 
doxy), maintained on PPX with ciprofloxacin, acyclovir, 
voriconazole.

# Dizziness/ Orthostatic symptoms: Differential includes 
autonomic neuropathy ___ chemo vs medication side effect 
(reported on voriconazole PI but incidence not included). 
Endocrine and cardiac sources less likely based on normal ___ 
stim (___), normal TSH (___), and normal LVEF (___). The 
role of anemia has also been considered, however, the Hgb has 
been stable for several days. Switched fludrocort -> midodrine 
___. Midodrine titrated with good effect. Discharged on 
midodrine 7.5mg QAM and at noon, and 10mg QPM given symtoms 
occur o/n or in early AM

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Stage IIA breast cancer s/p mastectomy: Continued tamoxifen 
daily

# Atypical chest pain: Had point tenderness above mastectomy 
scar and in R axilla, at different points during 
hospitalization. Most likely MSK or neuropathic and resolved 
prior to discharge. However, given h/o breast CA, there was 
concern for recurrent breast cancer. If symptoms worsen, would 
obtain chest imaging (CT v. MRI) to evaluate for masses.

RESOLVED ISSUES:
================
# Pulmonary Edema/Borderline O2 sats: Acute pulmonary edema in 
setting of fluids with medications and as treatment for acute 
leukemia ___, improved O2 sats ___ and ___ after diuresis. 
Repeat TTE showed normal EF. Responded to Lasix 20mg IV PRN

# Tick exposure: tick bite ___ wks prior to presentation. 
Treated w/ doxycycline x2 weeks. Serologies returned negative.

# Pain: Severe multifocal pain on admission, worst site low back 
spasms; significantly improved. Improvement coincident with 
chemotherapy suggests cancer-related pain most likely; 
differential includes infection and electrolyte shifts. Negative 
lyme serologies argue against infection. Not requiring pain 
management today.

# Loose stools: Loose stools for several days without abdominal 
pain or tenderness.  Differential is medication side effect, 
infection or GVHD. Given benign abdomen and no history of 
chronic GHVD, most likely medication effect. C diff negative 
___ and ___. Resolved w/ discontinuation of cefepime___.

TRANSITIONAL:
=============
- ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION: If persistent orthostatic sx, refer 
to ___ clinic
- CHEST PAIN: Had intermittent chest pain near mastectomy site. 
If progresses while patient immunosuppressed, please consider 
the need for imaging/ recurrence

spiked a fever to 100.3. He had a persistent oxygen requirement 
of ___ with sats in the low to mid ___. He was eventually 
placed on a non-rebreather, reportedly more for comfort. Oxygen 
saturations were 100% on non-rebreather.  Due to concern for 
leukostasis given his hypoxia and altered mental status he was 
transferred to the FICU for initiation of pheresis.
 
On arrival to the MICU, his sats were 95-96% on non-rebreather.

ER/PR positive and HER-2/neu negative. Final stage: Stage IIA
carcinoma left breast. Followed by Dr ___. The Recurrence
Score makes clear that if he were to take ___ years cof Tamoxifen
the recurrence risk would be very small, i.e., 5%. and hence
Tamoxifen recommended. Started Tamoxifen on ___.

- ___: Admitted to the hospital for elective
bronchoscopy for diffuse pulmonary opacities b/l predominantly 
in
the lower lobes. Pt was SOB after playing tennis for 45 minutes
which led to the CT scan and bronchoscopy. All cultures 
including
pathology were unremarkable. Pt was started on Vfend 350mg po 
bid
in hospital for presumed fungal infection which was decreased.
- ___: Diagnosed with COP based on Chest CT and PFT's 
likely
sequele of a viral infection. Started on macrolide therapy with
Clarithromycin and Singulair given clinical stability and lack 
of
hypoxia. CT chest 6 weeks later on ___ did not show 
improvement.
Repeat PFT's on ___ showed mild to mod reduced DLCO in the
64% range c.w 76% prior to transplant. Given stability of
clinical symptoms it was decided to watch closely and not
intervene.
- ___: Worsening SOB. CT chest and PFT's suggestive of
worsening COP and DLCO. Hence started on PSE 40mg/day on 
___
tapered to 30mg on ___, 20mg on ___ and 10mg on ___ given
steady improvement and eventually weaned off.

aspirate demonstrated 1.5% donor cells by FISH. However lineage
specific chimerism demonstrated > 95% donor CD3s in peripheral
blood.
- ___: BM aspirate/biopsy repeated with recovery of counts
post-re-induction with MEC. No morphologic evidence of leukemia
seen. No e.o FLT3 TKD D___ mutation identified. Lineage 
specific
chimerism on peripheral blood upon count recovery and FISH on BM
aspirate demonstrated full donor chimerism.
- ___: After extensive discussion with family and ___ team,

CTA CHEST ___. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. 
2. Peribronchial nodular opacities within the upper lobe are 
similar compared 
to ___, likely infectious or inflammatory nature. 
3. New small bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
atelectasis. 
4. The esophagus and partially imaged stomach are extremely 
distended with 
fluid.  Esophagus is quite distended with fluid/debris from the 
stomach to the 
upper chest.  Query slow transit from the stomach. 
This also places patient at increased risk for aspiration. 

ECHO ___
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

XR ABD ___
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.  No evidence of obstruction or 
ileus.

CXR ___
The endotracheal tube is not visualized.  The gastric tube 
extends into the 
stomach.  The tip of a right internal jugular central venous 
catheter projects 
over the mid SVC.  The tip of an incompletely evaluated PICC 
line projects 
over the upper right atrium. 
  
Re-demonstration of diffuse bilateral opacities, greater in both 
lower lung 
zones which likely reflect atelectasis and pleural effusions.  
Mild 
superimposed pulmonary edema is also present.  The size of the 
cardiac 
silhouette is unchanged. 
  
Persisting gaseous distention of the stomach. 

Derm path ___
Focal dyskeratosis involving epidermal basal layer and 
follicular epithelium, see note.
Note: The findings are subtle but are suggestive of early acute 
graft versus host disease. Initial and
level sections are examined.

Echo ___
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Views 
of the right ventricule are limited but it appears that the 
right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular global and regional 
systolic function. Mild mitral regurgication. At least mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of stage IIA 
breast cancer ___ left mastectomy and currently on 
Tamoxifen and relapse of AML post allogeneic RIC MRD (sister) 
stem cell transplant (Day 0: ___ for intermediate risk AML 
in CR1 after being in remission for ___ years. He was re-induced 
with MEC upon relapse (___) and rcd DLI from same 
donor (sister) on ___ after achieving remission 
subsequently found to have relapse post-DLI with 12% myeloblasts 
on ___ and now s/p 10 days decitabine (___) 
without response and increasing WBC/blasts who presented with 
hypoxia, dyspnea on exertion, and diffuse bone pain.

MICU COURSE:

# Goals of care: upon arrival to ICU, had long discussions w/ 
family and oncology about his prognosis and goals. Initially 
patient and family decided to proceed with leukopheresis, 
curative intent chemotherapy to transplant, and intubation with 
the understanding that cure and overall improvement could not be 
guaranteed. As his multiorgan failure progressed and felt his 
AML could not be cured given persistent blasts, renal failure, 
GVHD, and inability to get to transplant, the family decided to 
transition to CMO on ___ and he was terminally extubated with 
family at bedside. He was transferred to the floor where he 
passed away on ___.

# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
# Dyspnea on Exertion: found to be hypoxic at home to low ___ 
while at rest. Not symptomatic except more recently with 
exertion. Likely multiple factors contributing. Severe bone pain 
in chest/ribs likely limiting air movement and resulting in 
atelectasis. Also concern for leukostasis given progressively 
worsening WBC and blasts and so received pheresis upon arrival. 
CTA negative for PE but did note new small effusions and stable 
pulmonary opacities. Of note, recent work-up for URI symptoms 
revealed pulmonary opacities as above and positive B-glucan. 
Therefore, he was treated broadly for bacterial and fungal 
sources as well as PJP. Influenza PCR negative. He was intubated 
prior to initiating chemo given his respiratory status and 
anticipated worsening respiratory function with chemotherapy. In 
discussion with ID and oncology felt infectious cause was 
overall less likely but given severity of illness was covered 
with broad antibiotics and antifungals, which were adjusted with 
his renal failure (below) and transaminitis. Overall, his poor 
respiratory status was felt ___ leukemia/leukostasis, volume 
overload ___ renal failure. He also intermittently required 
pressors to maintain his blood pressures, felt perhaps related 
to his sedation but also covered for infections. He transitioned 
to CMO on ___ so abx were stopped and he was terminally 
extubated.

# Relapsed AML with neutropenia: relapse after being in 
remission for ___ years post allogeneic transplant. AML relapse 
was diagnosed on ___ with appearance of D835H mutation, 
normal cytogenetics and 97% donor T-cells on peripheral blood 
chimerism. Re-induced with MEC (___), s/p DLI from 
sister on ___ and now s/p 10 days of decitabine with 
increasing WBC/blasts. ___ protocol started ___ and 
completed his first cycle. He was monitored for tumor lysis and 
received rasburicase as needed. Also received allopurinol and 
hydroxyurea was stopped. GCSF was started given his neutropenia. 
Given his renal failure he was not a candidate to receive 
another transplant. His course was also complicated by GVHD 
which manifested as diffuse erythema and skin sloughing w/ 
positive nikolsky. Derm was consulted and skin biopsy showed 
GVHD. In discussion with onc and his poor prognosis from these 
findings, he was transitioned to CMO on ___.

# Acute Kidney Injury & TLS: likely prerenal ___ initially that 
resolved but then worsened while on pressors and after chemo 
started on ___. Also had contrast load earlier in 
hospitalization, several nephrotoxic meds and TLS despite 
management as above. Renal was consulted and initially he was 
trialed on Lasix gtt without good response. Because of his 
volume overload affecting his respiratory status and electrolyte 
derangements, he was started on CVVH. This was stopped on ___ as 
above.

#AF with RVR, STE, tropinemia: his course was also complicated 
by AF with RVR and STE with tropinemia. Cardiology was consulted 
and felt his ST elevations and elevated troponins were related 
to demand and global myocardial ischemia as opposed to focal 
infarcts. Given his overall poor health and instability, did not 
feel he was a candidate for catheterization or for systemic 
anticoagulation. His echo did not show any focal wall motion 
abnormalities and showed hyperdynamic LV function. He was rate 
controlled as tolerated.

# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: secondary to AML. No evidence of 
active bleeding. Expect to drop with chemo. He was transfused as 
needed. He did have episodes of frank hemoptysis with clots 
suctioned from his ETT for which he was managed supportively.

# Diffuse Bone Pain
# Cancer-Related Pain: likely secondary to bone marrow 
involvement from progressive AML with rising blasts. Sedated w/ 
fentanyl and then transitioned to dilaudid gtt.

Greater than 30 minutes were spent on planning and execution of 
this discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY:  Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male without 
significant past medical history originally presenting w/ DOE, 
fatigue, and diarrhea found to have anemia and thrombocytopenia. 
 Bone marrow biopsy consistent with AML on ECOG 2906 and 
randomized to 7+3 (day ___ now C1D28 with course complicated 
by neutropenic fever likely secondary to strep viridans 
bacteremia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# AML:  Patient presented with fatigue, diarrhea, and DOE, found 
to have anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Prelim reading on smear 
shows multiple blasts concerning for AML.  Bone marrow biopsy 
was performed and confirmed AML.  The patient was started on a 
clinical trial and randomized to the 7+3 arm (Day ___.  FISH 
negative.  Karyotype normal.  NPM negative, FLT3 negative 
consistent with intermediate Risk genotype.  Hemoglobin 
electrophoresis with 100% Hgb A.  Day 14 bone marrow is ablated, 
no blasts.  A bone marrow donor screen was begun and the 
patient's sister is a confirmed donor match.  The patient had a 
repeat bone marrow on Day ___, the day of discharge. 

# Neutropenic Fever:  Patient spiked fever to 102.5 on ___ 
w/ exam significant for erythema around line site.  CXR/UA were 
both negative.  Pt. c/o headache and sinus pressure.  Underwent 
Head-CT without any acute infectious process noted.  Blood 
cultures positive for strep viridans 2 out of 4 bottles.  
Central line (originally placed ___ pulled for concern of 
line infection.  Pt. was started on vancomycin and cefepime but 
continued to spike fevers for several days.  Pt.'s ongoing 
fevers were thought to be related to subtherapeutic vanc level 
vs. fungal infection vs. endocarditis without source control vs. 
G-CSF as pt. was started on neupogen around time of first fever. 
 TTE returned without evidence of endocarditis.  Given continued 
fevers, pt. was started on empiric micafungin and a chest CT was 
done which showed possible early viral vs. fungal pneumonia.  
Pulm was consulted who indicated that this could be early fungal 
pneumonia but that BAL at this point would not be useful.  Pt's 
neutropenia resolved.  He had a B glucan, galactomannan, and DFA 
viral swab which all returned negative.  ID recommended treating 
Strep bacteremia for 10 day course with nafcillin.  Pt. without 
central line, therefore continued vanc for ___ompleted on day of discharge.  

# Headache:  The patient experienced significant frontal 
headaches during his admission.  He had a Head CT which was 
normal.  At first, his headaches were thought to be due to 
anemia as they improved slightly with pRBC transfusions.  His 
anemia resolved and his headaches continues.  The patient 
underwent a Head MRI given the acute onset of a sharp headache 
that woke pt. from sleep in the early morning of ___.  MRI 
revealed no evidence of acute intra-cranial process.  The 
headaches improved dramatically when the patient was taken off 
of his neupogen.  This was thought to be the cause.

# Mild Transaminitis:  Both hepatocellular and cholestatic 
hepatitis new as of ___.  Mostly likely ___ to 
fluconazole.  As such, fluconazole was discontinued.  At time of 
discharge, pt.'s LFTs have plateaued and seem to be somewhat 
downtrending.

# Diarrhea:  The patient had several days of ongoing diarrhea 
during his hospitalization.  C. diff PCR was negative.  Diarrhea 
resolved.

Transitional Issues:  
1.  CT Scan:  Pt. had a CT scan which showed semi-solid nodules 
randomly distributed in lung fields possibly consistent with 
early viral pneumonia.  A repeat chest CT without contrast was 
recommended.  You have a CT scheduled on ___.

2.  Infectious Disease Consult:  Pt. requires outpatient 
infectious disease consult prior to transplant

3.  Dental Clearance:  Pt. has a dental appointment on ___. 
 He will bring with him the transplant paperwork to be completed 
at his appointment.  

4.  Flu Shot:  The decision was made not to give the flu vaccine 
given the pt's future chemotherapy and likely immunosuppressed 
state.

5.  Transaminitis:  Pt. had elevated LFTs likely ___ to 
fluconazole on ___  The fluconazole was d/c'ed at this time 
and his LFTs plateaued in the several days leading up to 
discharge.  Please assess for resolution with repeat LFTs.  If 
does not resolve, consider imaging for infectious source.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.  You presented with shortness of 
breath and fatigue and were found to have very low blood counts. 
 A bone marrow biopsy was done that confirmed acute myelogenous 
leukemia (AML).  You enrolled in a clinical trial and received 
7+3 (cytarabine and danorubicin).  You tolerated the 
chemotherapy very well.  Your repeat day 14 bone marrow biopsy 
showed an ablated marrow without blasts (diseased cells).  You 
spiked a fever and were started on broad spectrum antibiotics 
and your central line was removed.  Urine culture and chest xray 
were clear but your blood cultures were positive for a bacteria 
known as strep viridans.  Your antibiotics were narrowed to 
treat the bacteria and you no longer had any fevers.  You also 
had significant headaches during your hospitalization.  You had 
both a CT scan and MRI which showed no concerning process.  Your 
headache was thought to be due to the neupogen (filgrastim) that 
you were receiving.  We stopped the medication and your 
headaches resolved.  You had a bone marrow biopsy on your day of 
discharge that you tolerated very well.     

All the best,

Your ___ Team

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o F with history of DM, HTN presented to ___ on ___ 
with melana.

Pt presented with a hgb 7.6, admitted to ICU, and was seen by GI 
on day of admission and underwent EGD showing 4 ulcerations in 
the atrum, one of which was cauterized with BICAP.  Pt was 
transfused 2 units pRBC.  Overnight, pt noted to have episodes 
of heart block for which cardiology was consulted and 
recommended PPM for which thoracic surgery was consulted and pt 
now s/p PPM and pt transferred to floor, repeat hgb was up to 
___ yesterday around noon.  

Pt continued to have melana throughout the afternoon of ___ and 
repeat hgb 7.0 about 6 hours later for which pt was transferred 
back to ICU.  A repeat hgb 6.4 about 1.5 hours later and pt was 
hypotensive to SBP ___ (in the setting of getting Lisinopril 
earlier in morning). Due to concern for active bleeding, pt 
given additional IV access, started on IVF, and subsequently 
transfused another 2 units pRBC. GI was notified and pt 
underwent another emergent EGD with no active bleeding 
identified. Surgery was consulted and recommend a bleeding scan 
which showed an active GI bleed either from proximal small bowel 
or descending colon. Results discussed with surgery who 
recommended transfer to ___ medical facility for 
consideration of angiography and embolization. On return from 
the scan, pt became combative and agitated, was given 2mg IV 
Haldol and had another episode of melena and was started on 
another unit of pRBC for a total of 5.  Agitation was thought 
possibly secondary to recent sedation medications and multiple 
transfers between floor and ICU.  Family was updated.    

On arrival to the MICU, pt was alert but disoriented to place 
and time. She appeared confused with inattention. She denied any 
other complaints including CP, SOB, dizziness, lightheadedness, 
or abdominal pain.

RIGHT HEART CATHERIZATION ___:
===================================
Normal biventricular filling pressures
Moderate pulmonary hypertension
Depressed cardiac index

CXR ___:
==============
IMPRESSION:  
Since ___, unchanged pulmonary edema.   New right basilar 
atelectasis.  Persistent severe cardiomegaly and stable moderate 
left effusion 

Abdominal Ultrasound ___:
===============================
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Unremarkable liver echotexture.  Main portal vein is patent. 

2. Small ascites. 
3.  A 2.4 cm staghorn calculus is identified in the lower pole 
of the right kidney.  No hydronephrosis. 

ECHO ___:
==============
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed 
(LVEF= 25%) secondary to dyskinesis and thinning of the 
mid-distal anterior septum with moderate-severe hypokinesis of 
the remaining segments. The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt. 
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe 
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial 
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
mild cavity dilatation. Severe global LV systolic dysfunction 
with regional involvement suggestive of ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
Moderate functional mitral regurgitation. Right ventricular 
cavity dilatation with moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation 
and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  

CXR ___:
=============
IMPRESSION:  Right PICC terminates at or just below the 
cavoatrial junction.  ICD is in standard position.  Cardiomegaly 
is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion, mild to 
moderate edema, small right pleural effusion, and small to 
moderate left pleural effusion with apparent loculation 
laterally. 
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH CAD (s/p PTCA to mid LAD with DES, ICD single 
chamber x ___ yrs), HFrEF (EF 25% per MA records), Afib (off 
Coumadin in setting of BRBPR and hematuria), CKD stage III, 
transferred from ___ for possible cardioversion and 
management of acute on chronic HFrEF.

#Acute on chronic HFrEF (EF 25% on OSH TTE): Patient was 
admitted with a weight of 82.5kg and diuresed with Lasix gtt @ 
10 to a weight of 70.5 kg. His dry weight is 71.2 kg.  Labs were 
notable for a ___: 13667 (___), up from admission 7901.  He 
underwent a RHC that showed CI of 1.6, PCWP 18, however the 
patient was asymptomatic (in fact feeling much better than he 
had previously) so we opted for medical management with digoxin 
and held his metoprolol.  We uptitrated his afterload reduction 
upon being euvolemic. We transitioned him to 40 po lasix bid and 
increased his hydral to 20 tid and transitioned him to his home 
lasix regimen on discharge.  We recommend follow-up with his 
cardiologist in ___ days.

#Afib with RVR: CHADSVASC of 4. On admission, patient was off 
Coumadin in setting of hematuria and BRBPR. ICD interrogation 
revealed that his afib was likely chronic so he did not get 
cardioverted. We had him started on heparin gtt while titrating 
warfarin dosing. Patient also on digoxin for rate control. 
Digoxin was elevated in the setting of amiodarone, and therefore 
we monitored his levels very closely for signs of toxicity.  We 
also restarted him on coumadin with careful monitoring, and 
arranged for him to have ___ clinic follow-up after 
discharge.  

___ on CKD: Baseline 1.2-1.5, 1.8 on admission. Cr bumped 
transiently in the setting of overdiuresis but improved over the 
course of his hospitalization.

#Hematuria: Abdominal u/s with R kidney Staghorn calculi ? 
source. Repeat Ucx grew Pseudomonas >100k. Foley changed ___.  
Urology recommended no acute need for inpatient management, 
needs outpatient follow up with urology and nephrology. 

#Pulmonary HTN: Severe, based on RHC, appears venous.  Managing 
LV dysfunction as above.

#DM2: A1c 8.1 (___). We placed the patient on an ISS to control 
his hyperglycemia particularly in the setting of hypernatremia, 
to reduce free water loss and prevent further exacerbation of 
hypernatremia.  

#Thrombocytopenia: Improving. On admission, platelets 91. Per 
PCP, baseline ~200K, but downward trending since ___. 
Concern for HIT given recently started heparin, but HIT panel at 
___ was negative. Etiology unclear, likely 
medication induced. LFTs wnl. No e/o splenomegaly or cirrhosis 
on U/S.  Recommend work-up as outpatient as platelet levels 
improved during his hospitalization.

#BRBPR: Per OMR, GI bleed x 3 days prior to admission per 
patient. Never had a colonoscopy in the past. No current e/o 
bleed, H/H stable.  Patient was treated with PPI BId, lowered 
PTT goal, and monitored for active signs of bleed.  As his H/H 
remained stable, we did not pursue any further intervention 
while inpatient, and will recommend further work-up as an 
outpatient.

#Hypernatremia: Resolved with D5W. 151 up from 150 on admission, 
likely ___ fluid restrictions and loosing free water ___ 
hyperglycemia.

#CAD: Patient continued on ASA, statin, metoprolol.

#HLD: Continue statin as above.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with type 2 diabetes mellitus who presents in 
a hyperosmolar, hyperglycemic state in the setting of poor 
medication compliance. 

# Type II diabetes, uncontrolled with hyperosmolarity/HHS - 
diagnosed by Serum Glucose > 600(996), HCO3 > 15(24), no 
ketonuria,no  ketonemia . This is most likely from med non 
compliance as daughter has worries about this and patient notes 
there are times she forgets to take her insulin. No signs of 
infection though she does have a labial ulcer but it is not 
erythematous or painful. She was intially on an insulin drip and 
was weaned off, given long acting insulin and her BG levels 
returned to the 100s. Her MS was at baseline by the time she 
reached the MICU. ___ was consulted for recommendations on 
control of her BG levels.  Her K was repleted. She received 4 L 
of NS in ER and ICU. At discharge glucose remained labile but 
was in the range of 150-300 the day prior to discharge. Insulin 
regimen was limited by the pateint's schedule (she often sleeps 
until ___ and does not eat until noon) and the fact that her 
family can only administer insulin early in the morning and in 
the evening. Given these limitations, she was discharged on a 
regimen of Lantus 38 units in the morning and ___ 30 units at 
dinner. She was advised to continue to check her blood sugar 4 
times daily. She has a follow up appointment scheduled in the 
___ on ___. 

# Elevated Lactate - 4.9 on arrival and went down to 1.9. Likely 
related to hypovolemia, and/ or metformin in setting of poor 
GFR. Lactate resolved

# Met Acidosis with AG: AG initially 19 (from lactate), improved 
with HHS rx as above

# Microcytic Anemia with low MCV elev RDW. Differential includes 
iron deficiency (guaiac pos brown stool, h.o ulcer in the past 
per daughter though not ___ in records) vs thallasemia 
(per pt she has been anemic all her life).  Also on differential 
is MM in setting of renal failure. SPEP and UPEP were checked 
and were negative. Labs showed more of iron deficiency picture 
though it is possible she also has thallasemia. In setting of 
guaiac pos brown stool, history of angioectasisas seen on ___ 
and ___ ulcers pt should follow up with GI. H. pylori testing 
was positive, and patient should discuss with PCP and GI in 
follow up next week whether to treat for this.

# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Initial Cr 1.9, likely due to 
hypovolemia in the setting of hyperglycemia. Improved to 1.3 on 
discharge.

#Urinary tract infection:
Complaints of urinary frequency- UA was positive and culture was 
positive for pan sensitive E. Coli. She was treated with oral 
ciprofloxacin and will complete a 7 day course. Of note, she did 
have a low grade fever the day prior to discharge. She had no 
new symptoms of infection and WBC count was not elevated 
therefore no further infectious work up was pursued.

# Gyn: pt with labia majora ulcer and vaginal atrophy possible 
lichen sclerosis atrophicus. Could not insert foley because 
entroitus was so narrowed. Started on topical steroids and 
estrogen for atrophic vaginitis v. lichen. Will need gyn f/u.

CHRONIC ISSUES
#HTN:
continued hctz, losartan, propanolol

#Depression: continued buspirone and paroxitene

Transitional issues:
#Anemia
Consistent with iron deficiency- started on PO Iron but needs 
outpatient evaluation with Colonoscopy/EGD. Also H. Pylori 
antigen positive. Treatment not started in house.
#Vaginal atrophy
Needs GYN follow up

given D10 on way to ED.  

Active Issues:
#Hypoglycemia: resolved with administration of D10 and then 
further treated with ___ NS in ED.  Patient had one 
additional episode of hypoglycemia while inpatient morning of 
___ to 62 where she was diaphoretic, likely related to 
receiving her insulin too late in the evening.  The patient has 
otherwise been stable on a regimen of insulin ___ 20 units in

remained normothermic on the floor. 

___: Baseline Cr 1.1-1.2, on admission had increased to 1.5.  
Patient received hydration in ED and on the floor, had good PO 
intake and creatinine trended down to 1.2 which is baseline.

#Urethral Stricture:  Urology has seen patient and could not 
place Foley in ED.  PVR was 246.  Patient can currently void 
spontaneously but reports it takes her longer than usual.  
Throughout admission she did not require urinary 
catheterization.  Urology will see her in follow up in clinic.

Chronic Issues:
# HTN: remained on home blood pressure medications while 
inpatient, continue Losartan/HCTZ and Propranolol. 

# Hyperlipidemia: continued on Atorvastatin while inpatient

# Depression and Anxiety: Remained on Paroxetine and Buspirone, 
was euthymic throughout admission.

IMAGING:
___ CXR
HISTORY:  Cough and dyspnea. 
TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest. 
COMPARISON:  ___. 
FINDINGS: The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within 
normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky 
opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, and no 
focal consolidation is demonstrated.  There is no pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax.  There is evidence of prior 
vertebroplasty within a total body at the thoracolumbar 
junction. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
Streaky bibasilar opacities most likely reflective of 
atelectasis. 

----------
EKG:
Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Baseline artifact. 
Diffuse 
non-specific ST-T wave changes, new as compared to the previous 
tracing  
of ___, while the rate has increased. Clinical correlation 
is suggested.  
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ F h/o IDDM presents with cough for 3 days, sore throat, and 
found to be hyperglycemic to 600s in the ER with ___. 

#Acute bronchitis versus community acquired pneumonia: 
Initially, thought to be acute viral bronchitis based on 
symptoms, lack of CXR findings consistent with PNA. However, 
gven that she was initially hypovolemic at the time of her CXR, 
we thought it possible that a consolidation had not 
radiographically developed yet. Her initial pneumonia severity 
index was intermediate with inpatient stay being appropriate. 
Because the risk of not treating a possible pneumonia seemed 
quite high, she was treated with azithromycin with a planned 5 
day course. Sputum gram stain showed 4+ GPCs and some GNC/GNRs 
as well. Culture preliminarily showed commensal respiratory 
flora. She had significant cough, wheezing, and dyspnea without 
hypoxemia requiring scheduled q6 hour nebulizers. She improved 
significantly by ___ AM from a respiratory status standpoint 
and was felt to be safe to discharge home with antibiotic course 
ending ___. 
    Given that this is her second admission for respiratory 
infection this year without a history of COPD, smoking, or 
fibrotic lung disease, there was some suspicion that she may 
have developed a chronic underlying process such as 
bronchiectasis that predisposes to infection. This requires 
ongoing outpatient evaluation potentially with PFTs vs chest CT 
at some point if she were to have ongoing respiratory 
complaints. She was prescribed a spacer to help optimize her 
outpatient MDI.
  
#Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 1.6 on admission from a baseline of 
~1.2. This is most likely pre-renal azotemia in the setting of 
poor PO intake, osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia, and 
insensible losses with fever. Her sCr improved to baseline with 
IV fluids.

#Diabetes/Hyperglycemia: In the ER BS in the 600s. There was no 
elevated anion gap on labs. This was thought to be due to not 
taking her insulin the day of admission because she was feeling 
sick. While an inpatient her blood sugars were extremely hard to 
control. She varied between hypoglycemic to hyperglycemic 
throughout the day on her home regimen. Her outpatient HgbA1c 
has reflected poorly controlled diabetes. This may be due to 
labile blood sugars on her insulin regimen, not medication 
non-compliance, given that she was difficult to control while 
here. She was seen by ___ and ___ diabetic education RN. She 
had follow up appointments scheduled for ___. She was 
discharged on her outpatient Lantus and Humalog sliding scale.

Chronic Issues
--------------
# HTN: Losartan was held in the setting of ___, but was 
restarted at the time of discharge. HCTZ and Propranolol were 
continued.  

# Hyperlipidemia: Atorvastatin was continued

# Depression and Anxiety: Paroxetine and Buspirone were 
continued
 
# GERD: Ranitidine was continued

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Outpatient titration of her insulin regimen
-Monitoring of respiratory complaints with further workup if 
frequent, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, it was a pleasure to be part of your care at 
___. You were admitted for concern for pneumonia and for very 
high blood sugar. We suspect that your cough and shortness of 
breath is due to an infection of the lungs. A sputum culture 
grew a few types of bacteria, so this may represent a pneumonia. 
You were treated with antibiotics (azithromycin) and will 
continue to take this medication through ___. We gave you 
breathing treatments with nebulizers to help open your airways 
and improve your breathing. At home, you will continue to use 
albuterol as needed with a spacer which we showed you how to use 
in the hospital. 
   Also, when you were admitted your blood sugar was dangerously 
high, likely because of a missed insulin dose, but severe 
illness can raise blood sugars too. We think high sugars and 
your respiratory infection caused you to become dehydrated. We 
gave you IV fluids to improve your hydration. We had doctors 
___ come see you to discuss your diabetes because 
your blood sugars were very high and very low during this 
admission. They would like you to follow up in clinic (SEE 
BELOW).

REPORTS:

CT TEMPORAL BONE ___. Soft tissue density in the right external auditory canal and 
middle ear with inflammatory changes extending into the soft 
tissues, findings are concerning for malignant otitis externa, 
recommend skullbase MRI for further assessment. No bony 
destruction identified. 
2. Asymmetric fullness of the ___ fossa on the right, 
new from 
___, could be secondary to inflammation in this region 
however, 
underlying mass is a concern, recommend direct visualization. 
This finding can also be assessed on a contrast enhanced 
skullbase MRI. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with Type II Diabetes Mellitus, 
hypertension, GERD, depression and tongue cancer who was 
admitted with right ear pain.

ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES:
#Otitis externa: Pt presented with one day of ear pain and 
serosanguineous drainage. Given recent history of poorly 
controlled Type II diabetes, leukocytosis and elevated ESR, this 
raised concerns for malignant otitis externa, although there was 
no granulation tissue on exam by ENT. This was further evaluated 
with CT, which showed soft tissue involvement and inflammation 
but no bony involvement, and also raised question of possible 
mass which may have represented inflammation from her current 
infection. Pt was treated for pseudomonas coverage with 
cefepime, PO cipro and cipro ear drops.  Pt's wound culture then 
grew group A strep and she was narrowed to ceftriaxone per 
Infectious Disease recommendations.  Both ENT and Infectious 
Disease consultants did not feel the patients presentation 
represented malignant otitis externa given her physical exam and 
culture data. MRI was considered as inpatient for further 
evaluation of questionable mass seen on CT, but patient was 
clinically improved with no pain or drainage, and the decision 
was made to follow up as outpatient with ENT in 1 week. She was 
discharged on 4 days Augmentin to complete antibiotic course as 
well as cipro ear drops.

#DM: Pt was hyperglycemic >500 upon arrival with concern that 
she might not have been taking all of her medication at home. 
Given her infections, the goal was for tight glucose control. 
Her home glipizide, liraglutide were discontinued and she was 
started on sliding scale standing insulin (which she also 
self-administers at home) and Glargine (on Levemir at home), 
with input from ___. With this regimen, the pt's blood 
glucose decreased to 100s-200s. On discharge, pt will resume her 
levemir pen and humalog, with adjustments to sliding scale. 
Family has been provided with copy of sliding scale regimen and 
the pt is already trained to administer insulin at home via pen 
mechanism. 
  
#UTI: Pt presented with reports of urinary incontinence and 
dysuria and her UA was grossly positive. Urine culures grew E. 
coli. On discharge, patient reports some ongoing burning on 
urination, but no other urinary symptoms and she is afebrile. 
She will be covered with Augmentin to finish course.
 
___: On admission, had rise in Creatinine to 1.6 from baseline 
(1.3-1.5). This resolved to baseline with fluids and reached 1.1 
on discharge day, suggesting hypovolemia likely from 
dehydration. Pt's lasix and losartan were held

CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:

#HLD:  Pt was continued on home atorvastatin
  
#GERD:  Pt was continued home ranitidine, omeprazole  

#Depression/anxiety:  Pt was continued home paroxetine, 
buspirone  

#HTN:  Pt was continued home amlodipine and propanolol. 
Losartan-HCTZ and lasix were held given ___, however creatinine 
improved by discharge day, thus losartan-HCTZ was resumed as 
outpatient. Given her decreased PO intake and lack of volume 
overload, her lasix was held and can be restarted as an 
outpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
[] Complete 4 more days of PO augmentin (last day ___
[] Pt to follow up with ENT
[] Pt to continue cipro ear drops until she is seen by ENT
[] Pt's CT temporal bone showed questionable mass. She will 
follow up with ENT regarding if further imaging with outpatient 
MRI is necessary
[] Pt to follow up in ___ given her poorly 
controlled diabetes
[] Pt discharged on 33 units Levamir at night and humalog 
sliding scale
[] Pt noted to be dehydrated with ___ on admission. Lasix 20 mg 
held on discharge and to be restarted as needed by PCP

IMAGING:
========
CXR (___): No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

CXR (___): Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There are 
no signs for focal consolidation or overt pulmonary edema. There 
are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. 

CXR (___): No relevant change.  No pneumonia.  No pulmonary 
edema. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural 
effusions.  The lateral radiograph reveals a status post 
vertebroplasty. 

ECHO (___): The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Normal estimated RV/LV 
filling pressures.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST (___): Combination of ground-glass 
opacities, solid nodules and solid/ground-glass nodules within 
hello might be consistent with diffuse infectious process. 
Alternatively atypical mycobacterial infection, hypersensitivity 
reaction, aspiration or vasculitis would be a possibility. 
Neoplasm is substantially 
less likely. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is another less 
likely 
possibility.  
Diffuse bronchial wall thickening and endobronchial secretions 
might reflect part of the in infection/inflammatory process. 
Irregularity of the upper trachea with be beneficial to proceed 
with direct evaluation. 

PROCEDURES:
===========
BRONCHOSCOPY ___: The bronchoscope was passed through the 
mouth and the into the oropharynx where the cords were 
visualized and appeared normal. The cords were anesthatized with 
topical lidocaine. The bronchoscope was then passed through the 
cords and into the trachea. Thick, yellow, adherent mucous was 
noted on the posterior segment of the trachea. This did not 
clear with suctioning or with instilled saline. The bronchoscope 
was then passed into the right mainstem and into the RUL where 
lavage was performed in the anterior segment of the RUL. The 
bronchoscope was then withdrawn and passed into the BI and into 
the RML where another lavage was performed. The remained of the 
bilateral bronchi were inspected and patent. A cytorush was used 
to brush the upper airway adherent mucous. The airways appeared 
edemetous and hyperemic throughout. 
 
Impression: Diffuse parenchymal lung disease 

Recommendations: ___ microbiology, cytology and pathology
Followup cytology 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ F PMhx HTN, DMII on insulin, recent UTI status post ___ of 
nitrofurantoin, admitted ___ w hypoxiam, cough and 
diarrhea, found to have Cdiff colitis, initially flu negative on 
admission, subsequently undergoing CT chest with concerning 
features and bronchoscopy with a viral culture demonstrating 
influenza A as well as evidence of pneumonia, started on 
antibiotics, discharged home 

#) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure / Acute Influenza A Infection / 
Community Acquired Pneumonia - Patient admitted with hypoxia and 
cough, initially presumed PNA and placed on 
azithromycin/ceftriaxone, which was subsequently discontinued 
when no infiltrates were seen on CXR.  Given persistant systems, 
CT chest was obtained and showed ""combination of ground-glass 
opacities, solid nodules and solid/ground-glass 
nodules"".  Pulmonary consult recommended Bronchoscopy, which 
showed ""diffuse parenchymal lung disease"", and possible concern 
for residual PNA. She was started on levofloxacin (7-day course, 
day 1 = ___ for CAP. In addition, viral studies sent from 
bronchoscopy returned positive for influenza A prompting 
initiation of oseltamivir (5-day course, day 1 = ___. Her 
saturation normalized and she was discharged home with PCP and 
___.

#) C. DIFF INFECTION/DIARRHEA: Stool positive for C. diff.  
Thought to be secondary to recent outpatient course of 
nitrofurantoin.  Patient treated with PO vancomycin. She was 
having 10 BMs/day on admission, and by the day of discharge 
these had reduced to 3 loose stools/day. This should be 
continued for 14 days after completion of Levofloxacin course as 
above.

#) CELLULITIS: Pt developed L hand cellulitis at site of prior 
phlebotomy.  This was clinically improving on the day of 
discharge, on levofloxacin for her pneumonia would also cover 
cellulitis. PCP should ___ for improvement.

(Proteinuria), last A1C 11.6. Levemir was uptitrated to 31units 
from 25units

#) YEAST INFECTION: On presentation, patient found to have yeast 
infection, thought to be secondary to recent antibiotics. 
Resolved with fluconazole q72hr. Nystatin cream was also used to 
groin area.

#) HYPERTENSION: Continued home amlodipine, held Losartan-HCTZ 
given mild ___ and infections. This should be restarted per PCP.

#) HLD: Continued home atorvastatin. 
#) ANXIETY: Continued home Buspar, paroxetine.
#) GERD: Continued PPI, held H2 blocker.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ on ___ for a cough, weakness, and 
diarrhea. You tested negative for influenza in the emergency 
department. We initially treated you for pneumonia, but because 
you also had a concurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) 
infection causing your diarrhea, when it was clear on imaging 
and in your bloodwork that you did not have a pneumonia, we 
stopped the antibiotics, treating only your C. diff infection 
with an antibiotic. It was also thought that you had a urinary 
tract infection, given your report of discomfort with urination, 
but with your concurrent yeast infection, it was decided to 
treat that, and your symptoms improved. 

Your diarrhea was still occurring on the day of discharge, but 
it was significantly improved from your arrival.

Unfortunately, your oxygen levels remained low despite our 
initial treatment. A picture of your heart was normal. We 
obtained a CT scan of your lungs, which was concerning was for a 
widespread lung infection or a medication-related insult to your 
lungs, possibly related to the treatment of your previous 
urinary tract infection. You were seen by our Pulmonology 
Fellow, who recommended that we use a scope to look inside your 
lungs and obtain fluid for analysis (bronchoscopy). While many 
of the results of this study have not yet returned, it was 
determined that you were positive for influenza and you were 
started on an antiviral medication called oseltamivir. 
Additionally, we decided to treat you with a full course of 
antibiotics in case you had a pneumonia that had only partially 
resolved. Throughout this time, your breathing was slowly 
improving, and you did not require extra oxygen for the last few 
days of your admission. 

You will follow up with Pulmonology as an outpatient. Thank you 
for allowing us to take part in your care.

IMAGING
===============
CT CHEST ___:  IMPRESSION:  
  
1. Extensive, confluent, bilateral airspace consolidations, most 
appreciable in the right middle and lower lobes, suggestive of 
pneumonia. 
2. Small right pleural effusion without rim. 
3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive in nature. 
4. Contrast opacification of the esophagus suggesting reflux.  
Although not necessarily related to pneumonia, the possibility 
of aspiration as an 
underlying cause could also be considered in the appropriate 
setting in 
addition to community acquired pneumonia. 
5.  Emphysema. 

TTE ___: Conclusions  
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. 
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall 
contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation 
is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be 
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 


IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular 
cavity size with low normal global systolic function in the 
setting of marked tachycardia. Right ventricular cavity dilation 
with free wall hypkinesis. Valvular anatomy and function could 
not be assessed, but severe aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis 
do not appear to be present.   

RUQ US ___: IMPRESSION: 
1. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease including hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis or 
steatohepatitis cannot be excluded on the basis of this 
examination. 
2. Moderate amount of ascites and a small right pleural effusion 

3. Nonobstructing right-sided nephrolithiasis. Limited 
evaluation of the left kidney.

(s/p multiple surgeries, on long-term opiates), prior cardiac 
arrest, transferred from OSH for management of severe 
hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure and septic shock 
secondary to multifocal Klebsiella pneumonia.

He initially presented to an OSH ___ at 
___) ___ w/ 2 days of productive cough, and R. 
chest discomfort, in setting of recent high dose steroid use for 
Crohn's flare. On presentation, he was febrile, hypotensive, and 
had severe hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure. He recieved 
aggressive IVF, was started on pressors, broad spectrum 
antibiotics, intubated, and admitted to the ICU. His sputum 
cultures ultimately grew pansensitive Klebsiella pneumonia.  

He was transferred to ___. Though he was not thought to have 
ARDS due to the unilateral nature of his pneumonia, he was 
ventilated using ARDSNet strategy for lung protection. He was 
treated with neuromuscular blockade to optimize ventilator 
synchrony. Despite these measure he remained acidotic with pH 
<7.2 from ___. He required vasopressor support with 
norepinephrine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine and was given 
stress dose steroids. He developed atrial fibrillation with RVR 
and ATN in the setting of shock. Over the next few days, he 
began to improve with decreasing pressor requirements, improving 
blood gases, and decreasing ventilatory settings, however his 
renal failure continued to progress.

In discussion with his husband (HCP) ___ and sister ___, 
they stated that ___ had clearly expressed that he would never 
have wanted to be intubated, nor would he want prolonged 
critical care or renal replacement therapy. Initially, since 
these measures had been initiated prior to discussion with 
family, they elected to continue with trial of critical care. 
However, after multiple discussions, in accordance with his 
previously expressed wishes, his family elected to transition 
his care to comfort measures only. He died on ___ with his 
family at the bedside.

History of Present Illness:
___ with NASH cirrhosis (Class C, MELD 27, c/b ascites, SBP, no 
known varices), DM2, who presents as transfer from OSH with 
decompensated cirrhosis c/b SBP, bacteremia, and anemia, now 
transferred to ___ for liver transplant eval:  
Pt has been hospitalized at ___ from 
___. She was initially admitted after labs showed 
development of acute renal failure (Cr 1.8 from baseline of 0.9) 
in the setting of SBP.  
In terms of her renal failure, her diuretics were held. She was 
given albumin in the setting of SBP. Diuretics until her Cr had 
stabilized to her baseline, at which time diuretics were 
re-initiated. Over ___ to ___, sodium began trending down from 
130 to 125, and Cr increased from 0.8 to 1.5. Additionally 
potassium increased to 6.2 on ___, increased T wave amplitude 
in leads V2-V4, concerning for hyperkalemic changes, for which 
she was treated with 2 g calcium gluconate, 10 units regular 
insulin IV/50 mL D50, kayexalate. Repeat ECG showed sinus tach 
at 121 bpm with decreased T wave amplitude from prior EKG. K 
prior to transfer was 5.4. As a result, diuretics were 
discontinued and albumin 1g/kg was administered.  
Her course was notable for sensitive Klebsiella bacteremia which 
grew in ___ bottles on ___. She was treated with 10 days of 
antibiotics from ___.  
Her course was also notable for acute hemolytic anemia and 
question of DIC. Pt had decreasing Hct during her early hospital 
course (___) with elevated indirect bili (8), LDH (222), and 
low haptoglobin (<10). CT abdomen showed a small rectus sheath 
hematoma was thought to be too small to explain this drop. At 
this time, labs were also consistent with mild DIC, thought to 
be due to sepsis in the setting of bacteremia. Her fibrinogen 
increased appropriately, however, her ___ and aPTT remained 
elevated at 20.9 and 53.0. This was thought to possibly 
represent a new baseline due to progression of liver disease.  
On ___, H/H fell to 6.7/19.1 and a repeat CT was obtained to 
monitor for possible change in previously imaged rectus sheath 
hematoma, which showed a mild increase in size. However, H/H 
stabilized to 8.0 on ___ so a transfusion was not performed. 
She was given Vitamin K 5mg PO daily for possible contributing 
Vitamin K deficiency.  
Prior to transfer, she was started on SBP prophylaxis with 
ciprofloxacin. Last large volume para was on ___ with 2 L of 
serosanguinous fluid removed (with negative tap).  
Her bilirubin has been trending up from 6.7 on admit to 15.9 on 
day of transfer. INR trend has been from 1.7 on admit, up to 
peak 2.4 on ___, trended down to 1.9 on transfer. Cr trend was 
1.8 on admit, trended back to normal on (___), now 
uptrending again with Cr 1.5 on transfer.  
Pt was tranferred to ___ for liver transplant eval.  
Patient has never had an EGD performed. Etiology of her 
cirrhosis appears to be NASH, however, patient also had elevated 
AMA so there is a question of primary biliary cirrhosis. No 
EtOH. ___, HFE, Hep B&C negative.  
Upon arrival to the floor, pt reports pain in right lower 
quadrant where she has ecchymoses. Otherwise denies concerns.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with NASH cirrhosis (Class C, c/b ascites, SBP, no 
known varices), DM2, who presents as transfer from OSH with 
decompensated cirrhosis c/b SBP, bacteremia, and anemia, now 
transferred to ___ for liver transplant evaluation.
 
#Decompensated ___ cirrhosis: Patient initially presented to 
___ with decompensated cirrhosis that was 
complicated by ascites and SBP wih Klebsiella bacteremia. On 
admission MELD was 27. Given earlier SBP and bacteremia she was 
treated with 4 days of ceftriaxone 2g to complete a ___nd then transitioned to prophylactic ciprofloxacin. She 
previously had EGD in ___ with grade 1 esophageal varices, per 
outside records. She was continued on outpatient lactulose tid 
and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, though intermittently 
refused lactulose. Throughout admission MELD uptrended and her 
clinical status worsened as described below. She was transferred 
to the MICU for further management.

#Liver transplant evaluation: Patient underwent transplant 
workup in house given rising MELD. Transplant infectious disease 
service were consulted and recommended extensive ifnectious 
workup given patient is from ___. She also underwent CT a/p, 
transthoracic echocardiogram, cardiac pharmacologic stress test. 
She had pulmonary function tests which were suggestive of 
undetermined restrictive lung disease.

#Renal failure: Patient had ___ on admission thought likely 
secondary to SBP. Initially this was responsive to albumin, but 
subsequently worsened with concern for development of 
hepatorenal syndrome. She became anuric and volume overloaded 
with worsening lower extremity edema, ascites, and pulmonary 
edema. She was transferred to MICU.

#Respiratory failure: Patient had some shortness of breath on 
admission which was improved substantially with nebulizer 
treatments. After receiving FFP and platelets prior to a 
paracentesis, her shortness of breath worsened with crackles on 
exam. This progress as renal function worsened with icnreased 
work of breathing, and new O2 requirement. TTE was done which 
did not show any diastolic/systolic dysfunction.

#Anemia: Patient presented with anemia and concern for 
hemolysis/DIC versus bleeding into a known rectus sheath 
hematoma at outside hospital. Labs were concerning for DIC with 
low haptoglobin and fibrinogen; however these values were felt 
more likely to be explained by her underlying liver disease. 
Rectus sheath hematoma was followed on imaging and did not show 
expansion. Her hemoglobin subsequently stabilized.

#Hyperkalemia: Patient presented with hyperkalemia to 6.2 at 
outside hospital, as well as in house. ECG was followed and did 
not show changes. She was treated with kayexelate wtih good 
improvement. 

#Adrenal insufficiency: Because patient had hyperkalemia and 
hyponatremia, there was concern for adrenal insufficiency. ___ 
stim test revealed inadequate response. Endocrinology were 
consulted and recommended further workup given concern that 
patient's liver disease may lead to erroneous ___ stim test 
because of impaired synthesis of cortisol binding globulin. As 
patient's clinical status worsened, however, this was not 
performed.

#T2DM: Uncontrolled, A1c 9.0. She was continued on long acting 
and sliding scale insulin in house.

#Hyponatremia: Thought likely secondary to liver failure and 
acute renal failure with prerenal presentation. Sodium level was 
followed.

MICU COURSE
=============
___ yo woman with NASH cirrhosis (Class C, c/b ascites, SBP, no 
known varices), DM2, who presents as transfer from OSH with 
decompensated cirrhosis c/b SBP, bacteremia, and anemia, 
transferred to ___ for liver transplant evaluation and 
subsequently to the MICU for respiratory distress due to altered 
mental status and potential dialysis 

#RESPIRATORY COMRPOMISE: Ms. ___ presented with acute 
respiratory compromise in the setting of worsening obtundation. 
Her tachypnea was likely multifactorial secondary to 
hypervolemia in setting of anuria and worsening abdominal 
distension with ascites that may be compressing the diaphragm. 
Her recent pulmonary edema, potentially secondary to TRALI, is 
likely also contributing. Given this presentation in combination 
with her obtundation patient was intubated for airway 
protection. The patient continued to be intubated throughout her 
MICU course. 

#CIRRHOSIS C/B ASCITES, SBP and ABDOMINAL DISTENSION: Ms. 
___ presented with known cirrhosis complicated by SBP early 
in her course s/p 14-days of CTX as well as ciprofloxacin PPX 
that was initiated on ___ after arrival to ___. Recently 
she had worsening abdominal distension that may be secondary to 
a gastric outlet obstruction that is either functional or less 
likely, anatomic. Patient was started on meropenem given 
potential SBP. The patient continued to worsen during her MICU 
stay with increasing lactate levels, hypotension, and continued 
altered mental status. After discussions with the physicians 
given the patient's poor prognosis, the family of the patient 
including her health care proxy chose ___ measures only. All 
non-essential medications were discontinued including 
antibiotics. The patient continued to deteriorate with worsening 
lactate, anuria, and hypotension. The patient passed away due to 
the complications of her liver disease. 

#ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Patient without very clear 
evidence of worsening creatinine however became anuric with 
increasing creatinine. Patient was in renal failure and in need 
of dialysis. The plan was to initiate hemodialysis but given the 
poor prognosis the patient's family switched goals of care to 
comfort measures only. 

#Ileus - patient continued to be without bowel movements over 
the course of her MICU stay. The OG tube was suctioned daily 
with eventually feculent material being extracted. A CT abdomen 
showed colonic ileus related to
ischemic changes vs. Oglivies which could have been contributing 
to her clinical status and worsening lactate. Given the poor 
prognosis no intervention was pursued.  

#COAGULOPATHY W/ CONCERN FOR ACTIVE BLEEDING: The patient had 
bright red blood at her posterior pharynx noticed during 
intubation. ENT was consulted and packed the nasopharyngeal 
pharynx with gauze with resolution of the bleed. The patient's 
INR continued to increase during her ICU stay. 

#ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Ms. ___ presented with obtundation 
that is likely multifactorial secondary to hepatic 
encephalopathy and progressive renal failure. Prior to passing 
the patient experienced ventricular tachycardia with subsequent 
bradycardia and decreased blood pressures. Morphine was 
administered to comfort the patient during her final hours.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU and monitored closely with q1h neuro 
checks.  He developed hypertension and tachycardia and was 
started on delerium tremens prophylaxis.  He developed fever and 
had thick secretions and was started on antibiotics for presumed 
pneumonia possibly aspiration related.  He was in a hard collar 
which was removed by the ICU team for a negative cervical CT 
done at ___. Serial imaging of the head was 
ontained on ___ and ___ which showed improvement of his SAH and 
stable SDH. He was extubated in the ICU and placed on face mask 
with good results. On ___ his ability to follow commands was 
greatly improved with the exception of his LLE. The leg would 
withdraw briskly to minimal noxious but no commands. He had no 
palpable step-offs or point tenderness. X-ray of the lumbar and 
sacral spine were obtained which showed no acute fracture. His 
exam remained stable and he was transferred to the neuro 
stepdown unit. An MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine was 
attempted but patient was unable to tolerate the study without 
significant sedation that would have required intubation. 
Medication was continued for ETOH withdrawl/agitation. His WBC 
count increased on ___ to 16.8 and a urinalysis was obtained 
which was negative. Doboff was placed ___ and tube feeding 
started and meds changed to via NGT.  His sodium which was 
slowly decreasing was followed closely and maintained within 
normal levels through tube feedings and free water bolus 
adjustments. Psychiatry consultation was requested ___ for 
assitance with withdrawal/agitation medication - they 
recommended haldol and to add pain medication.  The also 
suggested EEG which was obtained and results showed early 
diffuse encephalopathy and no epileptiform activity. He was also 
intubated in order to obtain MRI of the brain which showed 
diffuse axonal injury; MRI of spine was considered but not done 
as pt was moving all extremities with no motor deficits and the 
information to be gained from doing this study would not change 
current management. Speech and swallow continued to follow but 
he was unable to take PO so PEG was placed in the OR on ___. 
Tube feedings were started and increased to goal.  All meds were 
changed to PO and his home meds were started.  He finished up 
his course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and his 
prophylactic seizure medication and these were both 
discontinued.  He had high WBC that was slowly decreasing and 
all fever work up including cultures were negative. WBC ___ was 
16.1. Foley was removed but had to be replaced due to retention. 
Blood glucoses were mildly elevated throughout his 
hospitalization but better controlled once on tube feedings and 
resumed usual home meds.  Prolonged QT was found on EKG and 
haldol was discontinued.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo M with history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 
and CKD who is being transferred from ___ for 
ongoing fevers, C.diff infection, and transaminitis.

The patient was recently bitten by a dog and cat on his finger 
on ___, resulting in cellulitis. He started cefuroxime on ___ 
but stopped it after 2 days due to diarrhea. He again saw his 
PCP ___ ___ and was given IM ceftriaxone hen given bactrim, but 
again only took it for a few days due to diarrhea.  He was 
hospitalized at ___ ___ for worsening cellulitis of the 
hand. Xray was negative for osteomyelitis. He was evaluated by 
hand surgery and it was felt he did not need surgical 
intervention. He was initially placed on Unasyn, and all 
cultures remained negative, including the culture of the 
expressed fluid from the hand. He was transitioned to 
moxifloxacin before discharge. During this hospital stay he 
developed c. diff; he was initially started on flagyl which was 
transitioned to PO vancomycin.  He was discharged on ___ on 
moxifloxacin and PO vancomycin. Of note his ESR and CRP were 
elevated this admission, 92 and 222 respectively.  

He was then re-admitted to ___ on ___ with 
weakness, decreased PO intake, and decreased urine ouptut. Per 
his wife he was well after discharge for a few days, then became 
weak with difficulty ambulating and poor oral intake. He had no 
UOP for 48 hours prior to admission. On admission he had ___, 
fevers, and hypoxia. Siginificant labs on admission included 
creatinine of 3.1 (baseline 1.4-1.7), WBC 15.3, hct 34.3, and 
procalcitonin 0.2. He initially was continued on IV moxifloxacin 
and PO vancomycin. 

Renal consulted, and thought his ___ was due to ATN. Losartan 
was held at admission. Lasix was initially held but was 
restarted before discharge. He had urinary retention requiring 
foley placement. For evaluation of hypoxia, chest CT scan showed 
pleural effusions. BNP normal. Echocardiogram showed EF 40-45%, 
no change from prior. ___ dopplers were negative and V/Q scan was 
intermediate. Pulmonary consulted, and thought he had low 
likelihood for PE and thus he was not started on 
anticoagulation. The ___ hospital course was also 
complicated by transaminits, checked the day of transfer and 
elevated from admission labs, of unclear etiology. His statin 
was stopped and abd US was unremarkable. 

During his hospital stay he had daily fevers up to 101.3. With 
his first fever, he was given a dose of vancomycin in addition 
to the moxifloxacin, but none since. CT chest showed small 
pleural effusions but nothing concerning for infection. CT 
abdomen/pelvis was negative for infectious source. MRI spine 
without contrast revealed mild prevertebral swelling without 
discitis, osteomyelitis or abscess.  TTE without vegetations. 
Blood and urine cultures were negative. ID consulted at ___, 
and recommended stopping all abx besides PO vancomycin. He 
received his last dose of IV moxifloxacin on ___.

Of note, the patient's ESR and CRP were more elevated this 
admission, 120 and 263 respectively. His ___ was positive at 
1:320 in a mixed pattern--speckled and homogenous. ANCA pending. 
RF negative.

On the floor, he states that he overall feels well. He is having 
chills, but his dyspnea is at baseline. Diarrhea has improved 
substantially since starting the oral vancomycin. He failed a 
voiding trial on admission, with bladder scan revealing 900mL of 
fluid in his bladder. Foley was placed. He was confused on 
arrival. 

At the time of discharge, all Cx have remained negative, still 
no source of infection has surfaced, and the patient has been 
afebrile and otherwise stable for 4 days. He no longer has had 
episodes of diarrhea, and remains on PO Vanco until ___. He 
did have hypoxia with O2 requirement which resolved with one 
dose of Lasix 20 mg IV 24 hrs prior to discharge. The patient 
was evaluated and treated by physical therapy prior to discharge 
and was cleared to return to home with a walker and with his 
wife agreeing to take care of him.

Brief Hospital Course:
 This is a ___ yo M with history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 
and CKD who is being transferred from ___ for 
ongoing fevers, C.diff infection, and transaminitis.  

# Fevers:  Fevers up to 105 PR on admit. Unclear etiology. All 
blood cultures at ___ and ___ negative. No antibiotics 
given here at ___. Thought initially to be related to cat or 
dog bite on left hand month prior to admission. Differential 
included HACEK or bartonella endocarditis, left hand osteo. Left 
___ digit swollen on admission but improved per patient since IV 
antibiotics at ___. MRI done here showed no signs 
of osteo. CT abdomen negative for abscess. Bartonella, Lyme, Hep 
panel negative at ___. ID was consulted and 
recommended systematic imaging workup. However, patient's fevers 
resolved without intervention on day 2 of hospital stay, so 
workup was halted. Rheumatology was also consulted given a 1:320 
___ (homogenous and speckled pattern) and recommended an 
antibiody panel. Results for all rheumatologic tests were 
negative (attached).  ___ labs showed negative RF, ANCA. 
Also on differential for these fevers that quickly came on and 
resolved was aspiration pneumonitis, given ground glass 
opacities seen on CT. Pt remained afebrile and asymptomatic 
throughout the last four days before discharge. Only question 
was small bump in ___ on last day to 11.7 from 9.8, but not too 
concerning considering resolved clinical status.

#  C.diff: Diarrhea improving on transfer to ___, already on 
PO vanc. PO Vanc 125 q6h x 2 weeks since last antibiotic (last 
day of vanc ___.
 
#  Hypoxia: Was on 4LNC on admit and O2 requirement slowly 
decreased over hospital stay without intervention. Completely 
weaned from O2 by discharge. Pt improved with one 20 mg dose of 
Lasix, so possibly developed some pulmonary edema. He also has 
COPD at baseline. Found to have ground glass opacities in upper 
right lobe.  Possibly due to COPD which was treated with home 
inhalers. Also possibilty of aspiration pneumonitis as above.

#  Transaminitis: appeared at OSH while admitted; possibly 
medication induced or related to current overall process. 
Improved over hospital course.

# Gait difficulty: On last two days before discharge, pt worked 
with ___ in multiple sessions to get ready to go home. He was 
cleared by them to return home with a walker and with his wife 
as a caretaker to help him.

# Hypotension: Experienced one episode of hypotension to 
80's/40's during last ___ session on day of discharge. Quickly 
resolved spontaneously, but we also decreased Losartan to 50 mg 
qd and discontinued Felodipine.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#CKD: ___ from ATN at OSH resolved on admission. restarted home 
losartan and diuretics.

# Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: continued coreg, ASA; restarted 
home losartan and Lasix.

#HTN: Holding Felodipine and decreased Losartan to 50 mg qd on

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for fevers, nausea/vomiting, 
elevated liver tests, and C Diff intestinal infection. Most 
likley, the cause of you initial fevers was due to the cat and 
dog bite that you suffered prior to coming in. Your fevers 
improved without antibiotics, and your blood cultures never 
identified an infectious source. You were treated with 
Vancomycin by mouth which is for the C Diff infection as well. 
In your last four days here, you did not have a fever and you 
did quite well. You were evaluated by physical therapy and they 
worked with you during your last two days here. You were having 
some trouble walking by yourself but seemed to improve with 
their sessions, so you were deemed safe to go home. On your 
final day, your blood pressure dropped a little bit while 
walking with the physical therapy. However, you felt fine and 
your blood pressure improved quickly, so we decreased the dose 
of Losartan (now on 50 mg daily) and discontinued the Felodipine 
to help keep your blood pressure normal. It is very important 
that you see your PCP ___ 1:45 on ___ to follow up on these 
issues. It was a pleasure taking care of you. Thanks!

All the best,
Your care team at ___

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yoM with a PMH significant for developmental mental 
delay, seizure disorder, and blindness who is being admitted to 
the CCU following pericardial drainage for a moderate to large 
pericardial effusion.

He lives ___ a group home and he has been complaining of 
abdominal pain for about a week. He went to his PCP ___ ___, who 
was unable to examine him due to agitation. He then went to 
___ ED on ___ with the same complaints and his vitals at 
the time were Afebrile, HR 110s-120s, SBP 130s, 91% RA. He was 
acutely agitated and required Haldol 5 mg IM, Haldol 5 mg IV, 
Ativan 2 mg IM, and dilaudid 0.5 mg IV. He then got a CT abdomen 
to evaluate his abdominal pain and it showed a moderate to large 
pericardial effusion, small bilateral pleural effusions, and no 
significant intra-abdominal process. He then received a bedside 
echocardiogram that showed RV collapse, he was given 2 L NS, and 
he was transferred to BID ED. ___ the ED here, his BP was 
143/104, HR 128, RR 24, and 93% room air. Labs significant for 
wbc 10.8 (72% poly, 14% lymph), hgb 9.2, INR 1.3, K 5.7, Cr 0.8. 
An echocardiogram ___ the ED showed the IVC was non-collapsible, 
but the RA was not invaginating with diastole. EKG showed NSR, 
tachycardia, with PR depression ___ I/II, elevation ___ AVR, 
decreased voltages, no electrical alternans. He was acutely 
agitated and required intubation (fentanyl, versed). He was then 
taken to the cath lab to have a pericardial drain placed, but 
prior to the procedure his pulse was nonpalpable with a dropping 
BP, and he required 20 seconds of chest compressions with ROSC. 
He then received a pericardial drain without complications and 
~400 mL of bloody fluid was drained. He only received about 300 
mL of IVF ___ the cath lab.

On arrival to the CCU: T 98.8, BP 98/64, HR 103, on 
volume-controlled CMV with FiO2 50%, PEEP 5, set RR 20, set Vt

IMAGING:
========
TTE ___:
  The left atrium is normal ___ size. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global 
systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is 
unusually small. with normal free wall contractility. There is a 
large pericardial effusion. The effusion appears 
circumferential. Stranding is visualized within the pericardial 
space c/w organization. The pericardium appears thickened. There 
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial or 
right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. 
  IMPRESSION: Large circumferential pericardial effusion. 
Thickened parietal pericardium. No echocardiographic evidence of 
tamponade. Normal LV function. Small RV cavity size with normal 
function.  

CXR (AP Portable) ___:
IMPRESSION:
Evidence for bilateral pleural effusions and consolidation or 
atelectasis ___ the left lower lobe.  Prominent cardiac 
silhouette. 

TTE ___:
  Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
systolic function is significantly depressed. The apical The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. There is a 
small-moderate sized pericardial effusion ___ the apical views 
the fluid is all echodense and there does appear to be tagging 
of the RV wall to the pericardium raising question of 
constriction. ___ those views the effusion is small, all < 1.0cm, 
and the fluid is echodense. The subcostal windows are quite 
limited, but the posterolateral pocket may be a little bigger 
there measuring up to 1.3cm. It is hard to make out whether any 
of that fluid is simple, but I suspect it is also echodense like 
the rest of the pericardial fluid. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
 IMPRESSION: Small to moderate sized echodense circumferential 
pericardial effusion. Pleural effusion. No 2D echo evidence of 
tamponade. Depressed global right ventricular systolic function. 

 The images and the report from ___ are not available for 
review

CTA Chest ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism within limitations of the 
study limited by patient motion. 
2.  There is a large nonhemorrhagic pericardial effusion with 
pericardial 
drain ___ place. There is associated leftward interventricular 
septal bowing  and contrast reflux into the hepatic veins 
suggestive of right ventricular strain. 
3.  Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions are larger 
compared to ___. 
4.  Bilateral compressive atelectasis with collapse of the left 
lower lobe and posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe.  
There is also linear atelectasis ___ the left upper lobe. 

CXR (AP Portable) ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Central pulmonary vascular congestion with new mild edema 
since the ___ examination. 
2. The lung volumes remain low.  Unchanged pleural effusions and 
bibasilar 
atelectasis. 

CT Chest w/ Contrast ___:
IMPRESSION:  
Decrease ___ size of pericardial effusion. 
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy is unchanged, the lymph 
nodes are borderline,  likely reactive.  
Large bilateral layering pleural effusions associated with 
adjacent atelectasis are stable. 
No definitive new lung abnormalities are detected. 

TTE ___:
  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic 
function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%). Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. There is a moderate sized 
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. The 
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or 
other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade. However, ___ the presence of a non-free-flowing 
pericardial effusion, these signs may be absent despite 
impairment of right ventricular filling.
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
the pericardial effusion is larger.  

TTE ___: 
  Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is a small to 
moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears 
circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with 
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. However, there is 
significant, accentuated respiratory variation ___ 
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired 
ventricular filling. 
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
the effusion appears smaller.  

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  
Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. 
Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved, but 
moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette remains, 
exaggerated by very low lung volumes.  
There is no mediastinal venous engorgement to suggest elevated 
central venous pressure.  Pleural effusions are likely, but not 
large.  No pneumothorax.

inflammatory/bloody output. Serial TTE post-procedure showed 
persistent, but much improved and stable pericardial fluid as 
well as possible constrictive physiology. He also had positive 
inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR). Extensive work-up did not reveal 
clear etiology with work-up negative for TB, thyroid 
dysfunction, malignancy, and infection intrinsic to pericardial 
fluid. Most likely explanation would be that patient had 
pneumonia (as below), triggering para-pneumonic pericarditis and 
effusion with subsequent heart failure as a result of effusion 
and possible constriction. He was diuresed intermittently with 
Lasix while ___ the CCU and started on colchicine therapy for 
planned 90 days. He was evaluated by c-surg and after discussion 
with patient's guardian (mother) and essential return to 
baseline functional status, it was decided not to pursue any 
invasive procedures such as pericardial stripping vs. window. 
After evaluation and treatment with physical therapy, he was 
discharged back to his home facility.

#Hypervolemia: Patient had low albumin, constrictive physiology 
and lower extremity edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and 
elevated CVP on admission. This was felt to be due to acute 
inflammation (leading to low albumin) and effusive/constrictive 
physiology, treated with Lasix while ___ the ICU. He was 
euvolemic at discharge off any maintenance diuretics.

#Pleural effusions: Given extensive work-up (detailed above), 
patient was noticed to have large pleural effusions likely due 
to para-pneumonic inflammation and volume overload. He underwent 
U/S guided drainage of his left-sided effusion (exudative) 
without clear signs of infection with ___ during this admission 
and improvement noted on subsequent imaging.

#HCAP: Patient was admitted with fever and pulmonary 
infiltrates, and overall picture that was felt to be consistent 
with pneumonia. He was treated with course of 
vancomycin/cefepime/azithro as such. Unfortunately, only 
positive growth from BAL and cultures from multiple sources was 
Gamella from blood (per ID felt to be likely contaminant). His 
respiratory status improved to baseline at time of discharge.

#Rash: During this admission, patient noted to have rash on back 
from b/l shoulders to top of iliac crests, diffuse erythematous 
plaques and papules with poorly demarcated borders covering most 
of back; no sloughing, vesicles or purpura, blanchable ___ 
nature. This was felt to be possible heat rash or possible drug 
effect. However, no concerning findings c/w SJS/TEN or 
significant eosinophilia on lab work. This self resolved with 
mobilization from the bed, prior to discharge.

#Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was initially 
intubated and sedated prior to admission due to report of 
hypoxia and agitation, which would have potentially complicated 
pericardial drainage. He was found as above to have pneumonia, 
pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, and 
atelectasis/incomplete collapse of bilateral lower lobes. CTA 
chest also showed no signs of PE. He was extubated with 
treatment of his multiple conditions as above on ___ and 
quickly was weaned to room air prior to discharge.

#Bradycardia: While intubated, patient had multiple episodes of 
bradycardia with possible junctional rhythm, never lasting more 
than seconds to a minute. These were all felt to be vagal ___ 
nature as they occurred ___ the setting of bladder scan, trach 
adjustment, and ventilation changes. He was monitor closely on 
tele without further episodes post-discharge.

#Anemia: Baseline H/H 13.2-___-40. Iron studies c/w slight 
anemia of chronic disease. Has been low likely because of 
hemodilution ___ the setting of IVF. His H&H improved with 
supportive care.

#Malnutrition: He had low albumin possibly due to acute 
inflammation/illness and prolonged intubation. He did receive 
tube feeds while intubated and was quickly restarted on regular 
diet prior to discharge.

#Coagulopathy: INR 1.2 on admission, today 1.7. Unknown 
etiology. ___ malnutrition, liver dysfunction, medication 
induced. This was most likely due to malnutrition and vitamin K 
dysfunction as INR improved quickly after initiation of 
nutrition.

#Seizures (chronic): Continued on home Depakote 500 mg BID

#Developmental delay/behavioral issues (chronic): Continued 
during hospitalization on home Seroquel, trazodone, and celexa.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You came to ___ because you 
were having stomach pain and it was discovered that you had 
fluid around your heart.

What was found ___ the hospital?
- Your had fluid around your heart, called a pericardial 
effusion.
- Your had fluid ___ your lungs, called a pleural effusion.
- You had an infection ___ your lungs, called pneumonia.
- You had high levels of potassium ___ your blood, called 
hyperkalemia.
- You had difficulty breathing and were on a mechanical 
ventilator for 1 week.

What was done for you ___ the hospital?
- The fluid around your heart was causing problems with pumping. 
You went to the catheterization lab. A drain was placed to 
remove fluid. After two days, most of the fluid was gone and the 
drain was pulled out. The fluid was sent for laboratory studies 
to look for a cause like infection or disease, but no cause was 
found. We continued to monitor your heart with pictures 
(transthoracic echocardiograms and chest xrays). You were given 
oral medications to keep the combat the inflammation around your 
heart. The fluid did not reaccumulate and you are safe to go 
home with follow-up with your doctor.
- Samples of the fluid ___ your lungs were taken by two methods. 
The first was a bronchoscopy, where a tube with a video camera 
was placed down your throat to look inside your lungs. The 
second method was a pleurocentesis, where a needle was put ___ 
your side and the fluid was pulled off. These samples were sent 
to the laboratory for studies to look for a cause. We found 
indicators of infection, but no specific bacterium that was 
likely to cause it. You had chest x-rays to watch for 
reaccumulation, and that did not happen.
- For your infection, you were see by specialists from the 
infectious diseases and pulmonary divisions. You most likely had 
a pneumonia. You received antibiotics for several days. You had 
a fever with this infection. You received acetaminophen. You had 
your intake and output monitored to make sure you did not become 
dehydrated. Your symptoms improved and you are safe to go home. 
- Initial laboratory studies showed that you had high levels of 
potassium ___ your blood. You received fluids and diuresis at 
different points during your hospitalization. You had frequent 
electrocardiograms and laboratory studies to monitor for effects 
of high potassium. Your potassium level returned to normal. 
- You came to ___ on a mechanical ventilator to help your 
breathing while you were sick. You were on the ventilator for 
several days. You showed us you could breathe on your own, so we 
stopped the ventilator and you were able to breathe on your own. 
You did not require re-intubation.

What should you do when you go home?
- For the fluid around the heart, you should take a new 
medicine, called colchicine, described below.
- Follow-up with your primary care doctor.
- Ask your primary care doctor to schedule follow-up appointment 
and transthoracic echocardiogram with a cardiologist.

NEW MEDICATIONS
- Colchicine 0.6 mg by mouth ___ the morning and at night, every 
day. This medication is for your pericarditis. You should take 
it for 3 months, last dose ___.

Otherwise, you can continue taking the medications you had taken 
at home before coming to the hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with PMH significant for HTN, hypothyroidism 
and alcoholism who presents with one-two weeks of ataxia and 
altered mental status per family.  

#___'S ENCEPHALOPATHY: Ms. ___ came in with change in 
mental status over the past two weeks. According to family, she 
was slow to respond to questions and had forgotten to do some of 
her daily activities. She has a history significant for chronic 
alcohol use. In addition to change in mental status, she also 
had ataxia with unbalance on feet. She did not have 
opthalmoplegia. Given the altered mental status and ataxia, she 
was treated for Wernicke's Encephalopathy. She was given 
thiamine 500 mg IV TID for 3 days, followed by thiamine 500 mg 
IV daily until she left against medical advice on ___. Prior to 
discharge recommendation was to take thiamine 100 mg PO daily. A 
CT of the head did show cerebellar atrophy which also likely 
played a role in her change in mental status. Vitamin B12 was 
found to be low at 216, therefore she was given B12 IM 1000 mcg 
daily was from ___. Recommendation for was vitamin B12 IM 
1000 mcg daily for 10 days and then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg 
weekly for ___ weeks, then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg monthly. 
Since the patient left AMA, she was given cyanocbolamin 1000 mcg 
PO daily. Neurology was consulted. They believed the source of 
the altered mental status likely was multifactorial including 
vitamin deficiencies of thiamine, B12, as well as chronic 
sequelae of alcohol use, recommended neurology f/u. With 
supplementation with thiamine, vitamin B12, multivitamin and a 
balanced diet, her altered mental status improved and she was 
near baseline, however we advised that she stay in house for 
further rehabilitation given that she didn't pass ___ due to 
instability and did not qualify for rehab.  She was advised of 
the risks of discharge including further instability leading to 
falls and at the extreme, death, however she elected to leave 
regardles.

#GOUT: Ms. ___ has a history of gout. During hospitalization 
she developed swelling, erythema, and warmth of the right ankle. 
This was initially treated with naproxen 750 mg PO, followed by 
250 mg PO Q8H with meals for five days (day 1: ___. The 
gout responded well to the naproxen. As she left AMA, we 
recommended she continue the naproxen for 2 additional days 
after the symptoms resolve. We also advised her to contact her 
PCP if the symptoms last more than one week.

#HYPOTENSION: During hospitalization, Ms. ___ had systolic 
blood pressures ranging from the upper ___ to low 100s. She 
remained asymptomatic when her blood pressures were low. She did 
not feel chest pressure, tightness, shortness of breath, or 
lightheadedness/dizziness when standing. Initial thought was 
that it was due to poor nutrition/low volume satus. Fluid 
repletion and improved diet did improve blood pressure into the 
high ___. Even after IVFs and improved nutrition blood pressure 
still remained low.  An AM cortisol was obtained to assess 
adrenal function and was normal at 11.  She had no evidence of 
infection and remained asymptomatic. 

#ANEMIA: Patient presented with a macrocytic anemia. This was 
likely in the setting of chronic alcohol use as well as her 
previous bariatic surgery. B12 was low as noted above. To 
replete B12, we gave Vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg daily. We also 
provided folic acid even though folate was within normal limits 
at 8. H/H remained relatively stable during hospitalization and 
was 8.8/29.2 at the time of discharge. She remained asymptomatic 
with no lightheadedness, dizziness, sob, or chest pain. She 
required no transfusions during hospitalization.     

#ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE: Ms. ___ has a significant history of 
alcohol consumption. She remained on CIWA protocol and did not 
score. She received multivitamin, folate, thimaine and B12 as 
noted above. Social work was consulted. Based on report from 
social work, she was willing to attend ___ 
Substance Abuse Program. Social work also provided a list of 
local AA meetings. Ms. ___ noted motivation in trying to 
become sober. Her main motivation is improving herself for her 
son. 

#HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH was obtained during hospitalization was 
1.3. Hypothyroidism stable. She was continued on her home dose 
of levothyroxine.  
 
#ASTHMA: Well controlled and without wheezing or dyspnea on exam 
during hospitalization. We continued home Advair and albuterol 
rescue inhaler prn.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ 
with ataxia (difficulty with your balance) as well as slowing of 
your thinking. You were initially evaluated with imaging of your 
head (head CT) which showed atrophy (weakening) of the 
cerebellum (part of the brain). This was likely due to chronic 
alcohol use in the past. The ataxia and slowing of your thinking 
was also likely due to the chronic alcohol use in the past. In 
order to help improve your thinking, we gave you a vitamin 
called thiamine which helped improve your thinking as well as 
your balance. We also continued you with other vitamins and 
minerals including Vitamin B12, folic acid, a multivitamin. We 
also had the neurologists (brain doctors) come and see you to 
evaluate your unsteadiness on your feet and slowed thinking. 
They also recommended continuing with the vitamins that we had 
been giving you. The neurologists would also like to have you 
seen as an outpatient with a neurologist within the At___ 
network. We also had social work come see you to discuss options 
regarding resources to help quit alcohol consumption.   We 
recommended that you stay in the hospital given your ongoing 
difficulty with standing and climbing stairs, and need for 
physical therapy as well as ongoing IV thiamine.  You elected to 
leave against medical advice.  You were advised of the risks of 
leaving against medical advice, including falling with 
possibility of serious injury including death, worsening 
confusion, poor pain control and worsening of gout.  You 
understood and accepted these risks and elected to leave against 
medical advice regardless.

While in the hospital, you were also treated for a gout flare.  
You should continue to take naproxen for 2 days after your 
symptoms resolve and you should contact your PCP if your 
symptoms last for more than a week.

We encourage you to continue taking these vitamins as they are 
helping improve your symptoms.  

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

2.3, creatinine 2.9->2.5 (baseline 0.9), bicarb 8->11, VBG 
7.25/33/40/15, lactate 2.1-> 1.5, neg UA.
Exam was significant for normal mentation and brown, guaiac 
negative stool.
CXR was without acute findings, and CTA abd/pelvis was without 
source of bleed, but showed hepatic steatosis, colitis versus 
portal colopathy, and heterogenous kidneys.
A cordis was placed in the R femoral vein for resuscitation.
The patient was given:  
___ 13:12 IVF 1000 mL NS 1000 mL 
___ 13:53 IVF 1000 mL NS 1000 mL 
___ 15:23 IVF 1000 mL NS 1000 mL

___ 15:34 IV BOLUS Pantoprazole 80 mg 
___ 16:16 IVF 1000 mL NS 1000 mL  
___ 16:16 IV Vancomycin 1000 mg  
___ 16:30 IV DRIP Pantoprazole  Started 8 mg/hr 
4 units pRBCs.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient's vitals were 97.8 77 81/43 
18 99% on RA. She was persistently hypotensive to ___. She 
was mentating well. She was given a total of 4L IVF and started 
on levophed without blood pressure response. A-line was placed.

Results from any one IgM assay should not be used as a
sole determinant of a current or recent infection.
Because IgM tests can yield false positive results and
low levels of IgM antibody may persist for months post
infection, reliance on a single test result could be
misleading. If an acute infection is suspected, consider
obtaining a new specimen and submit for both IgG and IgM
testing in two or more weeks. To diagnose current
infection, consider parvovirus B19 DNA,PCR.

PERTINENT STUDIES:
==================
___ CXR:
FINDINGS:  
Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are 
normal. The 
pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural 
effusion or 
pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  
Chain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the 
abdomen. 
IMPRESSION:  
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality 

___ CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:  
1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI 
bleeding at this time. 
2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes 
with hazy 
mesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver 
disease. 
3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis 
versus portal colopathy.
4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible 
striated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude 
pyelonephritis. 

___ TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral 
valve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with 
certainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature 
of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  


___ ___
IMPRESSION:   
1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins 
from the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. 
2. Patent left lower extremity veins. 

___ ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) 
secondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left 
ventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is 
hyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings 
suggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo 
pattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  

___ CTH:
IMPRESSION: 
1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since 
the prior 
examination of ___, greater than would be expected 
for the 
patient's age. 
2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. 

___ LIVER US:
IMPRESSION:    
1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or 
cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. 
2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. 

___ IVC filter placement:
FINDINGS:   
1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of 
a IVC 
thrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the 
IVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small 
in caliber and likely of no clinical significance. 
2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC 
filter. 
IMPRESSION:  
Successful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. 

___ ECHO:
Conclusions   
 The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
 IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. 
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial 
pericardial effusion. 

___ Unilateral RLE veins 
IMPRESSION:    
Extensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right 
lower 
extremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with 
perhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. 

___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study
Aspiration with thin liquid consistency.

___ Portable abdomen x-ray
Patient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends 
in the 
proximal jejunum. 

___ Renal ultrasound
No evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity 
consistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   
Small bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. 

___ - EGD
Duodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with 
Roux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both 
visualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by 
Wernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, 
presented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her 
course in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional 
deficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, 
hypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein 
thrombosis.

# Hypotension:
# Cardiomyopathy: 
# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:
Patient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; 
her Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low 
suspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was 
empirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was 
found, and these antibiotics were held until a series of 
presumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning 
cortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within 
normal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain 
her persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed 
in sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse 
Takutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. 
Of note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose 
thiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet 
beriberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of 
gastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion 
of cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for 
which she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was 
successfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her 
MICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised 
in her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her 
alcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic 
pressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the 
patient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood 
pressure in the 100s.

# Anemia: 
-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in 
the setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing 
pRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, 
ultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by 
Hem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis 
or malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of 
chronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the 
setting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who 
found no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course 
and no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac 
positive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. 
Patient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is 
ongoing.

# Thrombocytopenia: 
There was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool 
normal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic 
evidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI 
were consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic 
gut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy 
was negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid 
resuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her 
anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of 
alcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical 
illness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more 
stable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a 
developing EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to 
MICU admission and did not require further blood products until 
___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic 
illness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time 
after transfusion).  

# Diarrhea:
Negative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. 
Possibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with 
changing to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of 
banana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and 
optimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.

# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):
Presented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She 
manifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff 
assay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early 
course of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed 
sepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been 
under-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally 
deficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but 
recurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal 
failure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume 
overload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to 
have ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as 
persistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being 
trialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be 
initiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her 
renal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She 
was evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal 
recovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine 
sediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but 
nephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient 
already requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits 
with the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output 
remained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed 
for longer-term access.

# Respiratory Failure:
Patient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload 
eventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, 
on ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode 
with persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; 
she was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in 
the ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular 
intervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode 
was attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and 
bronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She 
was extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting 
of a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from 
blood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. 
After restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, 
she was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same 
exact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit 
due to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being 
investigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains 
off supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were 
empirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with 
leukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to 
aspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will 
finish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and 
remained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of 
her hospitalization. 

# Alcohol Abuse:
Patient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work 
who gave resources, though patient is not interested in 
counseling.

# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:
Nutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring 
significant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued 
need for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.

# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia 
resulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding 
tube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her 
caloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids 
by a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation 
after receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to 
tolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by 
mouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.

# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:
Patient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early 
hospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; 
however, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose 
thiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was 
consulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly 
low. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to 
remain on standing thiamine.

# Deep Vein Thrombosis:
Patient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, 
asymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which 
___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in 
the R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of 
persistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though 
because of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She 
should have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as 
well as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was 
maintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin 
to follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.
 
# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:
As described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her 
MICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the 
setting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was 
unimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near 
the end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool 
which raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she 
was HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative 
prior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology 
and EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule 
study failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt 
the study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.

**Transitional:**

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO 
with HD given renal failure
-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube 
feeding, potential need for G-tube
-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for 
blood transfusion

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still 
drinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, 
hypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, 
hypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was 
sent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for 
pancreatitis.

#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, 
was found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and 
levophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was 
subsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan 
sensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated 
with broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which 
was narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood 
pressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with 
overall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the 
bacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and 
further findings described below in # abdominal pain. The 
differential also included pelvic process given adnexal 
tenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the 
differential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis 
obtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right 
thigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of 
infection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV 
with ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could 
be the source of infection, particularly concerning for 
malignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as 
well. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up 
with pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the 
patient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of 
infection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of 
the chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and 
hemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from 
the MICU.

# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and 
fever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan 
sensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, 
RUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD 
dilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any 
abnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase 
with elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her 
pain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and 
CT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. 
Choledocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a 
possibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The 
differential also included pelvic etiology, though patient 
denied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain 
improved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating 
PO well on discharge.  

# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain 
(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis 
on CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential 
included EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources 
given elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may 
also have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting 
of possible GI infection and may not have been representative of 
true pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved 
throughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on 
discharge. 

# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, 
however  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. 
choledochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider 
contribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST 
less suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved 
throughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. 

# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from 
hemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has 
recovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. 
She received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. 
Creatinine on discharge was 1.8.

# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in 
the past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T 
bili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the 
setting of septic shock. Differential included infection and 
medication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as 
heavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood 
transfusions during the admission.

# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard 
liquor per day, with her last drink being the day before 
admission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with 
multivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA 
the day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry 
overnight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to 
at that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by 
psychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have 
capacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed 
regarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance 
abuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.

# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to 
lactic acidosis on presentation

# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. 
Urine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for 
outpatient removal.

====================
CHRONIC ISSUES
====================
# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 
mcg PO DAILY. 

# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of 
septic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume 
overload and soft pressures.

# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and 
soft pressures as well. 

# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol.

IMAGING
CXR (___):
FINDINGS:    
The lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within 
normal 
limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  IVC filter is 
partially visualized.   
IMPRESSION:    
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

CT A/P (___): 
IMPRESSION:   
1. Mildly limited exam without oral or IV contrast.  No 
abnormality identified to explain the patient's left lower 
quadrant abdominal pain. 
2. Post gastric bypass surgery without evidence of obstruction. 

MICROBIOLOGY
___: Urine culture negative, blood cultures pending
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of ETOH abuse, 
hypotension likely ___ autonomic instability, and recent ATN 
requiring temporary hemodialysis who was admitted for elevated 
Cr.
 
#AoCKD, stage 3B: On initial presentation, her Cr was elevated 
to 3.9. Urine electrolytes were notable for FeNa of 2.6, 
concerning for possible ischemic ATN in the setting of her 
hypotension (see below). However, her Cr improved each day s/p 
IVF and was 2.3 at discharge (baseline ~1.8) which was 
reassuring. No known recent nephrotoxic drugs to raise concern 
for toxic ATN, though she may have been taking ibuprofen (she 
couldn't remember which pain reliever she has). She endorsed 
left flank pain, but this was chronic and she had no hematuria 
or dysuria to raise concern for nephrolithiasis or other 
obstruction. She continued to make appropriate volumes of urine 
and CT abdomen showed no hydronephrosis, which was reassuring 
against a post-renal process. 

#Hypotension: On initial presentation, she had systolic blood 
pressures in the ___ in ED, which improved to 117/69 with IV 
fluids. Her systolic blood pressures remained 100s-110s 
throughout admission. The cause of her initial hypotension is 
unclear. The most likely etiology is her known autonomic 
instability v. poor PO intake that the patient endorsed. Her AM 
cortisol was within an indeterminate range. She was afebrile 
with normal heart rates and no leukocytosis, so sepsis was 
unlikely. She denied chest pain, EKG without e/o ischemia or 
arrhythmia, and trop negative, so cardiac cause is unlikely. 
Patient denied history of vomiting/diarrhea to cause 
hypovolemia. She does endorse increased frequency and volume of 
urination, though seems unlikely that this would be significant 
enough to cause hypotension to the ___.     

#Anemia - Patient with stable macrocytic anemia (Hb 7.9-8.7) 
with elevated RDW and low MCHC, consistent with baseline. Her 
ferritin is elevated to 3080, TIBC is low, and transferrin 
saturation is 65%, likely consistent with anemia of chronic 
inflammation. She reports recent weight loss. Notably, she had 
negative HIV test in ___. She may also have bone marrow 
suppression from alcohol use. B12 and iron levels are wnl. In 
the setting of CKD, she may have reduced EPO production. Lastly, 
given anemia and kidney disease, multiple myeloma is on the 
differential. Her total protein is elevated and SPEP is pending. 
Notably, her calcium level is normal and she denies bone pain.  

#ETOH dependence: Reports drinking a pint of brandy daily, with 
last drink 6pm the night before admission. Throughout her stay, 
she denied shakiness or symptoms concerning for withdrawal, with 
stable CIWA of 1 for nausea. 
 
#Transaminitis: AST/ALT were mildly elevated on admission but 
were down-trending. INR was 1.0 and platelets within normal 
limits, indicating good synthetic function of liver. History and 
AST > ALT both argue for EtoH hepatitis. CT scan without 
evidence of ascites.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[ ] Patient should have chemistry panel drawn on ___ and 
faxed to ___'s office (to ensure resolution of ___.
[ ] Patient encouraged to monitor BPs at home.
[ ] Pending labs: SPEP, UPEP.
[ ] Given indeterminate AM cortisol, consider ACTH stimulation 
test if concern for adrenal insufficiency is high.
[ ] Patient should not take HCTZ, lisinopril, or any other 
potentially nephrotoxic medication.
[ ] Of note, lactate elevated on discharge despite normal BP. 
Thought to be secondary to poor clearance in the setting of 
chronic liver disease.
[ ] Ferritin 3000, consistent with anemia of chronic disease. 
Patient reported anorexia and weight loss. Consider further 
work-up as outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital because you had low blood 
pressures and your blood tests showed abnormal kidney function. 
We gave you IV fluids, which brought your blood pressures back 
up to the normal range. Your blood tests also showed that your 
kidney function was improving after getting more fluid. 

When you go home, you should try to drink fluids to help your 
blood pressure and kidneys. You should NOT take your lisinopril 
because this can cause low blood pressure and kidney damange. 
You also mentioned that you have taken hydrochlorothiazide in 
the past. You should NOT take this medicine because it can cause 
low blood pressures and can damage your kidneys more. 

Please keep the follow up appointment with your primary care 
physician on ___, see below). You should have repeat 
blood work done on ___ to ensure that your kidney 
function is back to normal.

Please monitor your blood pressure periodically at home. You can

IMAGING & STUDIES
======================
___ CT Abdomen and Pelvis: 
Fatty liver with large volume ascites. No splenomegaly. Patient 
is status post gastric bypass with the excluded stomach appears 
severely edematous with thickened walls. Diffuse anasarca.  

___ RUQ US: 
1. Patent portal vasculature. Patent right and middle hepatic
veins as well  as the main hepatic artery. The left hepatic vein
was not visualized. 
2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of
liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
steatohepatitis or significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot
be excluded on this study. 
3. Large volume ascites. 

___ CXR 
Bilateral low lung volumes with moderate bibasilar atelectasis. 
No evidence of intraperitoneal free air. 

___ TTE
 IMPRESSION: A left pleural effusion is present. Late bubbles 
seen in the left heart suggesting intrapulmonary shunting 
(bubbles appear at 8 beats). Normal biventricular size and 
systolic function. No pathologic valvular flow. 
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
global biventricular systolic function is more vigorous.  

___ EGD
Findings:
Esophagus:
Protruding Lesions1-2 small varices were seen in the lower 
esophagus with no stigmata of bleeding.  
Stomach:
Lumen:Evidence of a previous RNYGB was seen with a 
gastrojejunostomy. 
Duodenum:
Flat LesionsA single small angioectasia was seen in the jejunal 
efferent limb. There was no evidence of bleeding.  
Otherduodenum not seen due to post surgical anatomy.  
Other findings:A jejunal feeding tube was placed into the small 
intestine endoscopically, however during oro-nasal conversion 
was noted to have become dislodged and was no longer as deep at 
the nares as when endoscopically placed. It was then advanced 
and bridled at 70 cm, however due to the fact it moved after 
endoscopic visualization it will require CXR prior to use.  

___ CXR
Increased opacities at the right lung base may reflect a 
combination of
atelectasis and pneumonia.

___ Duplex Abdominal U/S
1. No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.  Intermittent reversal 
flow within the left portal vein.  Slow flow within the main 
portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins.
2. Cirrhotic liver without focal liver lesions.
3. Circumferential gallbladder wall edema, likely due to third 
spacing/underlying liver disease.
4. Small volume ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
==================
BRIEF SUMMARY
==================
___ with active alcohol use, alcoholic cirrhosis, Stage IV CKD, 
admitted for alcoholic hepatitis, decompensated cirrhosis, and 
anuric ___ requiring initiation of HD. Patient was alert, 
oriented, and feeling well at discharge. Outpatient HD and 
Hepatology follow-up were arranged.

==================
ACUTE ISSUES
==================
# Decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites
# Alcoholic hepatitis
# Hepatic encephalopathy
MELD Na 26 and Child C on presentation. LFTs and symptoms 
consistent with alcoholic hepatitis on cirrhosis; DF not high 
enough to warrant steroids. Had confusion and asterixis on 
admission consistent with HE. Had goals of care discussion with 
patient and family on ___ and confirmed she wants to pursue 
aggressive therapy, including EGD and HD; DNR/DNI in the event 
of arrest. She wants to be abstinent and eventually be placed on 
the transplant list. EGD showed ___ small varices with no 
stigmata of bleeding. She started lactulose and rifaximin for 
HE. Serial diagnostic paracentesis were negative for SBP. She 
had large-volume paracentesis on ___ for relief of tense 
ascites. ___ need outpatient LVP depending on whether she 
continues to be able to remove fluid via UF. She was maintained 
on high protein, ___ gm sodium diet and tube feeds. She will 
follow up with hepatology as an outpatient.

# Anuric ___ on CKD Stage IV
# ?Hepatorenal syndrome
She did not respond to albumin challenge, nor to 
octreotide/midodrine for possible HRS. Octreotide was stopped 
but she was maintained on midodrine for soft BPs. Outpatient HD 
___ arranged. PPD negative. 

# Abdominal pain
Multifactorial - alcoholic hepatitis, tense ascites, and 
possible acute on chronic pancreatitis (lipase 190). Was 
initially treated empirically for possible SBP but cell counts 
were not consistent; prophylaxis not indicated per Hepatology. 
Pain much improved after LVP ___. Repeat diagnostic para ___ 
remained negative.

# Severe protein calorie malnutrition
Nutrition was consulted. Dobhoff was placed for ongoing tube 
feeds, and high-protein diet and supplements were prescribed. 

# Hypoxemia
# Hepatic hydrothorax
# ?Hepatopulmonary syndrome
Patient had new 2L O2 requirement in setting of large R pleural 
effusion/hepatic hydrothorax, resolved after LVP. TTE did show 
evidence of pulmonary shunting which could represent HPS.

# Leukocytosis
Patient developed a new leukocytosis several days prior to 
discharge. Also had slight rise in bili and alk phos around this 
time. No fevers or localizing symptoms. Repeat infectious workup 
was unrevealing, including repeat diagnostic paracentesis, 
except for CXR equivocal for pneumonia. She was started on 
empiric oral levofloxacin for possible pneumonia, and 
leukocytosis stabilized for several days and LFTs improved 
somewhat prior to discharge. 

# Chronic macrocytic anemia 
Retics inappropriately low, consistent with marrow suppression. 
Likely multifactorial - EtOH, cirrhosis, splenomegaly, 
malnutrition, renal failure. No evidence of acute bleeding and 
not iron deficient on labs. B12 wnl. Hemolysis labs negative. 
EGD results as above. Will need continued attention as 
outpatient. 

# Chronic thrombocytopenia
Likely multifactorial - EtOH, cirrhosis, splenomegaly, 
malnutrition. No evidence for DIC or other consumptive process.

# Coagulopathy
PTT was elevated due to SC heparin, normalized after this was 
held and dose decreased to 2500 units BID. ___ were elevated 
due to cirrhosis. No evidence of bleeding, DIC, or other acute 
pathology. 

# Alcohol use disorder
Reports daily drinking prior to admission, about ___ pint qod to 
1 pint/day. Last drink ___. Denies h/o withdrawal. She 
received IV thiamine x 3 days and maintained on oral thiamine, 
folate and MVI. We discussed the importance of abstinence and SW 
helped arrange outpatient supports. We also discussed 
pharmacological assistance to treat alcohol use disorder and 
depression, however patient deferred at this time.

# Chronic RLE edema
# History of RLE provoked DVT 
DVT occurred after left knee fracture. IVC filter was placed in 
___. Course complicated by need for catheter lysis and 
extravasation into right thigh per patient. No longer on 
anticoagulation. Repeat Doppler this admission negative for 
persistent DVT. She continued on half-dose heparin SC.

=====================
CHRONIC ISSUES
=====================
# Hypothyroidism
TSH 2.1 this admission. Continued home levothyroxine.

# Gout
Reduced home allopurinol from 100 mg daily to every other day 
due to renal failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY:
=============
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with PMH EtOH cirrhosis c/b renal failure 
(HD ___, continued EtOH abuse (1 pint/day), and prior RLE 
DVT ___ ago) who presented from HD w/ SOB, then found to 
have dark stool and non-bleeding varices/ulcer on EGD, then 
transferred from ICU to ET for management of recent GI bleed and 
EtOH cirrhosis. She had variceal banding and was noted to have a 
large ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be 
the source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to 
prevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She 
remained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was 
discharged home in stable condition.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================
[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a 
hemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for 
interval change. 
[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is 
on high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB 
given her varices. 
[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. 
[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. 

[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. 
[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment 
for alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. 
[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. 

CODE STATUS: Full
CONTACT: ___, ___

ACUTE ISSUES:
============
#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large 
marginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding 
The patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath 
believed to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD 
session. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have 
melena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She 
required 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one 
grade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent 
bleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy 
encountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at 
anastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her 
EGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, 
carafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g 
IV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to 
her low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She 
was discharged with Hgb 7.3.

#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy
The patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, 
including up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation 
she had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She 
was given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was 
presumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on 
her ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and 
she was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by 
moderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued 
monitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy 
as an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol 
use.

#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol 
disorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as 
midnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was 
reported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms 
of withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. 
She was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social 
work was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed 
with her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her 
mother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all 
alcohol from the home prior to discharge. 

#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as 
a result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no 
evidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue 
for her, no further work-up was completed.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============
#ESRD on HD
#Anion gap metabolic acidosis. Received HD while inpatient. 
Acidosis presumed ___ renal disease.

#Chronic pancreatitis. Lipase elevated to 108, her diet was 
advanced as tolerated and tylenol for pain.

#Macrocytic anemia ___ bone marrow suppression from alcohol use. 
Treated with folate, CBC trended daily.

#Thrombocytopenia ___ bone marrow suppression from alcohol use. 
Observed and CBC trended daily.

#Hypothyroidism. Continued home levothyroxine.

#Gout. Continued home allopurinol.

==============
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with hx of EtOH cirrhosis c/b esophageal
varices s/p recent banding (___), stomach ulcer, ESRD (HD 
TTS), HTN, asthma who presents to the ED from ___ concerns of increased lethargy following a fall 
down stairs at home. The patient required 2u pRBCs for low Hgb 
in the ED and was noted to be lethargic, her lactulose was 
increased and she received HD and her mentation improved. She 
was discharged AAOx3 in stable condition.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Hepatic encephalopathy
#Uremic encephalopathy
#AMS
The patient presented from her hemodialysis center to the ED w/ 
lethargy and a known recent fall down a flight of stairs. At the 
time of presentation, she was noted to be lethargic but able to 
converse without difficulty. Upon arrival to the floor, she 
remained lethargic but arousable to voice and able to follow 
commands. She described not taking her lactulose recently, 
missing a session of HD as a result of her lethargy, and recent 
alcohol use. HE, uremic encephalopathy, and alcohol use were all 
considered as etiologies for her AMS. She was given lactulose at 
an increased rate and had runs of HD on back-to-back days. Her 
mentation improved to baseline, AAOx3, and she was returned to 
her usual lactulose dose and TTS HD schedule at time of 
discharge.

#Alcoholic hallucinosis
On day two of her hospitalization the patient described a 
hallucination in which a man was standing over her and repeating 
her name, ___ She was frightened and unwilling to open her 
eyes. This was concerning for alcoholic hallucinosis given the 
time frame and her recent alcohol use, so she was placed on CIWA 
protocol w/ lorazepam for management. By day three, her 
hallucinations had ceased and at time of discharge she was out 
of the alcohol withdrawal window.

#Acute on chronic blood loss anemia
At admission to the ED, the patient was noted to have a Hgb <7, 
so she was given 2u pRBCs, to which she bumped appropriately. 
She has a history of esophageal varices so she was monitored 
with daily CBCs and her Hgb remained > 7 for the rest of her 
stay. She had no evidence of blood loss (no melena, hematemesis, 
BRBPR) throughout her hospitalization. Given her recent fall, a 
CT was ordered to assess for an RP bleed but was negative.

#Fall ___ alcohol use
The patient states that she had been drinking and was exiting 
her closet at which point she fell down a flight of stairs. On 
admission, she had ecchymoses on her arms, legs, and scalp. CT 
head negative for intracranial hemorrhage, CT c-spine negative, 
and shoulder XR normal. She saw ___ while inpatient who 
recommended further ___ while outpatient, for which patient 
already has ___ services.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Alcoholic cirrhosis
Patient was monitored for signs of GI bleeds, but no evidence. 
She was started on rifaximin. Otherwise monitored daily MELD 
labs.

#ESRD on HD
Due to concern for uremic encephalopathy, was given HD on two 
consecutive days, then transitioned to home TTS schedule prior 
to discharge.

#Alcohol use disorder
Patient met with social work but stated she does not wish to 
stop drinking at this time. Was given resources for relapse 
prevention.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Discharge Cr 5.3
[ ] Discharge AST/ALT ___
[ ] Discharge T bili 
[ ] Discharge Hgb 7.3
[ ] Patient continues to drink alcohol and would benefit from 
therapy, was given resources from Psychology Today for 
clinicians in ___ area that take her insurance and have 
experience in addiction counseling
[ ] Would benefit from further ___ given recent fall
[ ] Weekly CBC and may benefit as an outpatient from scheduled 
transfusions, likely has chronic low volume blood loss from GI 
source leading to anemia
[ ] Would benefit from follow-up on whether she is taking 
lactulose, has history of non-compliance leading to 
hospitalization
[ ] Has missed HD sessions in the past leading to 
hospitalization, could benefit from further counseling
[ ] Had visual hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal and is 
actively drinking, on repeat hospitalizations will be important 
to monitor for signs of withdrawal, she describes this as her 
first episode
[ ] New prescription of rifaximin for patient, but at time of 
discharge unclear if insurance will cover/if she needs prior 
auth, would recommend following up to see if patient is able to 
get medication
[ ] Is taking baclofen for muscle spasms/aches, may be 
contributing to her frequent hospitalizations for AMS, would 
consider re-assessing if necessary in patient

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
===================
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with hx of EtOH cirrhosis complicated by 
esophageal varices s/p recent banding (___), stomach ulcer, 
ESRD on HD, HTN, asthma who presented with altered mental status 
from dialysis. The AMS is likely multi-factorial including 
lethargy from dialysis, recent excessive etoh intake, and 
non-compliance with lactulose. Specifically, she reports not 
taking lactulose for several months due to it causing diarrhea, 
therefore, she may only need 1x dosing a day. Her mental status 
completely improved the day after admission. The patient was 
encouraged to stop drinking and educated on the importance of 
taking lactulose and rifaximin. The patient is unaware of the 
medications she is taking and would benefit from close follow 
up. We discharged her with some medications to bedside. Please 
see below for more information

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================

MED CHANGES
[] Gave the patient four tiny bottles of lactulose and 
instructed her to use it if she or her son was concerned about 
confusion. Also filled rifaximin
[] Filled Advair prescription for asthma. Unclear if she is 
using inhaler and would likely benefit from getting a rescue 
inhaler as well
[] Filled baclofen that she takes for back pain (tiny dose) but 
this may be a deliriogenic that should be avoid in the future if 
she has recurrent confusion
[] Gave the patient folic acid and thiamine given concern for 
malnutrition and Wernickes during previous hospitalization
[] It was too soon to fill her levothyroxine. She states she has 
it at home. 
[] It was too soon to fill midodrine and dialysis vitamins
[] Continued Alcohol Cessation Counseling
[] Encourage cessation of tobacco

--Discharge Hgb 8.5
--Discharge weight 166 lbs

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Encephalopathy
Multifactorial with most important factor likely hepatic 
encephalopathy. Patient and son confirm that she has not taken 
her lactulose for ~ 1 month, had drank a marked amount of 
alcohol the night prior. Has hx of concern for wernicke's 
encephalopathy and prior admissions for alcoholic hallucinosis 
but no signs of withdrawal this admission. Treated predominantly 
with lactulose with recovery of mental status and folate and 
thiamine by mouth.  

#Alcohol use disorder
Patient met with social work on last hospitalization but stated 
she does not wish to stop drinking at this time. Was given 
resources for relapse  prevention. This admission she states 
that she has a social worker already and not interested in 
another consultation. Patient received thiamine, MV, and folate. 
She was monitored for signs of withdrawal but did not require 
treatment. 

#Etoh Cirrhosis

Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at the ___ 
___.
You came to the hospital because you were confused and sleepy at 
dialysis.
You were given lactulose to help with your confusion. This 
medicine works by helping you stool frequently. Please remember 
that if you do not take lactulose the confusion will return. We 
also encourage you to stop drinking alcohol. Your liver disease 
is worsening and you may die if you do not stop drinking. We 
wish you all the best, and once again it was a pleasure caring 
for you.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Team

and treatment. She was taken to the OR on  ___. Please 
refer to the operative note for details of the surgery.

Post operative course:

Neuro: The patient received morphine with good effect and 
adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient 
was transitioned to oral pain medications.  
 
CV:  The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;  
vital signs were routinely monitored.
 
Pulmonary:  The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.  Good pulmonary toilet, 
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged 
throughout this hospitalization.  
 
GI/GU/FEN: 
Post operatively, the patient was made NPO with IVF.   
The patient's diet was advanced when appropriate, which was 
tolerated well. 
A USG of the liver was done that showed arterial waveform at the 
porta hepatis, but no intrahepatic arterial waveforms 
appreciated. This was followed by a CTA of the abdomen to assess 
the hepatic vasculature.This showed occlusion of the main 
hepatic artery at the porta hepatis. There was some 
reconstitution of flow of the right hepatic artery.
The patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IVF 
were adjusted when necessary.  The patient's electrolytes were 
routinely followed during this hospitalization, and repleted 
when necessary.  

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. 
 
Endocrine:  The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
this stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. 
 
Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required during this stay.
 
Prophylaxis:  The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible. She was started on a heparin infusion and coumadin 
post operatively. After 3 days, the heparin infusion was stopped 
and Lovenox was started. She would have to continue to be on 
Lovenox until her INR becomes therapeutic on coumadin after 
discharge.
 
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well

- Any neurological issues, such as change in vision, speech or 
movement
- Swelling, drainage, or redness of your incision
- Any problems with medications, such as nausea vomiting or 
lethargy
- Fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit
- Headaches not relieved with prescribed medications

Activity:
- Start to resume all activities as you tolerate  but start 
slowly and increase at your own pace.
- Do not operate any motorized vehicle for at least 10 days 
after your surgery  your Nurse Practitioner can give you more 
detail at the time of your suture removal.  

Incision Care:
- Keep your wound clean and dry.
- Do not use shampoo until your sutures are removed. 
- When you are allowed to shampoo your hair, let the shampoo run 
off the incision line.  Gently pad the incision with a towel to 
dry.
- Do not rub, scrub, scratch, or pick at any scabs on the 
incision line.
- You need your sutures removed 7 to 10 days after surgery

Post-Operative Experiences: Physical
- Jaw pain on the same side as your surgery; this goes away 
after about a month
- You may experience constipation.  Constipation can be 
prevented by:
oDrinking plenty of fluids
oIncreasing fiber in your diet by eating vegetables, prunes, 
fiber rich breads and cereals, or fiber supplements
oExercising
oUsing over-the-counter bowel stimulants or laxatives as 
needed, stopping usage if you experience loose bowel movements 
or diarrhea

- Fatigue which will slowly resolve over time
- Numbness or tingling in the area of the incision; this can 
take weeks or months to fully resolve
- Muffled hearing in the ear near the incision area
- Low back pain or shooting pain down the leg which can resolve 
with increased activity

Post-Operative Experiences: Emotional
- You may experience depression.  Symptoms of depression can 
include
oFeeling down or sad
oIrritability, frustration, and confusion
oDistractibility
oLower Self-Esteem/Relationship Challenges
oInsomnia
oLoneliness

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old female with past medical history most 
remarkable for remote right sided parietal and cerebellar 
strokes with residual left sided weakness, right pericallosal 
aneurysm status post clipping in ___, hypertension, and 
hyperlipidemia whom presented ___ with right sided 
weakness found to have left corona radiata infarction. Etiology 
of patient's stroke uncertain, but suspect paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation given large vessel occlusion and now history of 
bilateral strokes in different vascular territories. No atrial 
fibrillation on telemetry, but have arranged for patient to be 
monitored with outpatient holter (scheduled ___. Patient 
has been taking aspirin 325 mg daily for stroke risk reduction, 
but this admission we have switched her to clopidogrel 75 mg 
daily. Patient's LDL found to be 95 and we have increased her 
rosuvastatin to 30 mg daily (from 20 mg daily) with hopes to get 
her to goal of less than 70. Patient by the time of discharge 
had full motor strength on the right and her exam remained 
remarkable for chronic left sided weakness. Patient was having 
difficulty with ambulating and was at high risk of falling. 
Therefore, she was discharged to acute rehabilitation to work on 
improved and safe ambulation. Patient was told to follow up with 
her primary care physician to obtain ___ neurology referral. 
Patient should be neurologist in 3 months from discharge. 

Transitional issues: 
Left corona radiate/motor cortex stroke: 
Please ensure that patient makes Holter placement appointment 
___.  Please ensure patient has scheduled appointment 
with PCP ___ days post discharge from acute rehabilitation to 
follow up on this hospitalization and to obtain referral to see 
neurologist 3 months post discharge. 

Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia: 
Patient needs to have levels followed up with PCP. If 
chronically low, might need hematology work up to rule out 
hematologic disorder.  Patient also with mild chronic kidney 
disease and mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase.  Would 
recommend starting with outpatient SPEP/UPEP to rule out 
multiple myeloma. 

Hyperlipidemia: 
Patient's LDL 98 this admission, increased rosuvastatin to 30 mg 
daily to work towards goal of less than 70.  Will need to follow 
up with PCP. 

Hypertension: 
There were no changes in her hypertension medications this 
admission, would follow up with PCP to ensure blood pressure 
adequately managed.

Discharge Instructions:
You presented to the hospital with right sided weakness and 
walking unsteadiness and were found to have had a stroke on the 
left side of your brain. Thankfully, it looks like you are 
recovering well from this stroke and we have transferred you to 
acute rehabilitation to maximize your recovery potential.  

We want to help prevent you from having another stroke and have 
therefore changed some of your current medications.  We have 
started you on clopidogrel 75 mg daily and you will discontinue 
taking aspirin 325 mg daily.  We have increased your 
rosuvastatin to 30 mg daily (from 20 mg daily) to help tighten 
control of your blood lipid levels. 

Ultimately, we are uncertain why you had a stroke, but we 
suspect that you have an abnormal rhythm in your heart that is 
increasing your risks of having strokes.  Therefore, will have 
scheduled for you to come to pick up a monitor to wear to 
possibly detect this abnormal rhythm.  

Please have your primary care physician send ___ referral for you 
to follow up with a neurologist in three months so that your 
stroke management can be reviewed. 

Thank you for allowing us to care for you, 
___ Stroke Team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o woman with a complicated medical history including 
insulin-dependent DMII (A1c 8.7% on ___ admitted for 
___ cellulitis. She remained afebrile and 
hemodynamically stable without systemic signs of sepsis. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# ___ cellulitis was evidenced by the 
complete absence of any pain with eye movement, ophthalmoplegia, 
vision changes, purulence, HA, sinonasal or palatal necrosis, so 
she did not need to have CT imaging given the very low 
likelihood of orbital cellulitis. Her cellulitis significantly 
improved with IV vancomycin and amp-sulbactam overnight, and she 
was subsequently discharged on a 7-day course of po Bactrim and 
Augmentin. 

# ___: Her hospital course was also notable for a mild ___ with 
creatinine of about 2 compared to baseline in the mid-high 1s, 
mostly likely pre-renal in etiology. She received some IV fluids 
in the Emergency Department and it remained stable. Outpatient 
lab order was placed to monitor creatinine and potassium while 
on Bactrim, though the Bactrim was appropriately dose-reduced 
for her eGFR.

# HTN: She had hypertensive urgency with SBP up to 209, though 
she remained completely asymptomatic and responded appropriately 
to her home antihypertensive regimen. Her SBP improved to about 
the 150s.
- continue home regimen of carvedilol, irbesartan, 
spironolactone, torsemide. Irbesartan was continued given the 
improvement in her ___ and the degree of her severe HTN

# Hyperglycemia: She also had significant hyperglycemia 
frequently to the 300s. Exacerbation likely due to current 
infection and potentially from recently completed prednisone 
course. Continue her home regimen of lantus 18 units qhs, 
humalog 10 units TID with meals, along with sliding-scale 
humalog for more optimal control while in-house.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# HLD: Continued ezetimibe.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine.

# CAD/MI hx: Continued home ASA, carvedilol, irbesartan. Not on 
home statin or clopidogrel.

# CHF (EF 60-65% in ___: Continued cardiac meds as above along 
with torsemide and spironolactone.

# Gout: Continued febuxostat. She is being worked-up by her PCP 
and has an upcoming Rheumatology appointment for her morning 
wrist/hand pain.

# CKDIII: Continued home irbesartan given her significant HTN 
and improvement in ___.

# a-fib on anticoagulation: Continued warfarin. Checking 
outpatient INR ___.

# Depression: Continued home bupropion.

# Chronic pain: Continued prn oxycodone.

# Anemia: Continued home ferrous sulfate.

 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- to complete 7-day course of po Bactrim and Augmentin. Bactrim 
is dose-reduced for her impaired renal function
- ensure resolution of ___ cellulitis with this 
antibiotic course
** She will have BUN, Cr, K, and also INR labs drawn on ___, 
___ and faxed to Dr. ___. Please monitor these labs 
given her CKD and Bactrim regimen. I confirmed with the on-call 
covering NP that these labs will be reviewed ___
- she may require up-titration of both her antihypertensive 
regimen and her insulin regimen given significant HTN and 
hyperglycemia while here, though these may be exacerbated by her 
infection and hospitalization
- f/u INR check for ___, as level may vary with antibiotic use

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your hospitalization. 
You were admitted on ___ due to swelling of your left eyelid. 
You were diagnosed with a skin infection called periorbital 
cellulitis (also called preseptal cellulitis), which means the 
skin of your eyelid has an infection, but it does not involve 
the sensitive structures around the eye.

Your infection has significantly improved, and you are now able 
to be discharged home on a course of oral antibiotics.

You also had very high blood pressure and blood sugars while in 
the hospital, though they stabilized with your home medications. 
Please be sure to follow-up with your PCP ___ 
further management of these issues.

You antibiotic prescriptions were sent to the 24-hour ___ below:

___
Store ___

Please be sure to also have your labs drawn tomorrow ___, 
___ at a local lab to be faxed to Dr. ___, and 
make sure to call your ___ so they review 
your INR check as well.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for palpitation and leg 
swelling. We think that your legs were swollen because your 
heart was not adequately circulating blood (heart failure). As a 
result, your heart also became stressed and started beating too 
fast (AFib with rapid ventricular response).

We changed one of the medicines that control your heart rate in 
order to slow it down and added a new medicine to help control 
your heart rate and blood pressure. We also gave you medicine to 
remove fluid from your body (called a diuretic). Your heart rate 
came under control and your leg swelling improved.

You also had an injury to your kidneys, likely from trying to 
remove fluid with diuretics. You will have your kidney function 
tests monitored closely after discharge and we have stopped or 
decreased medications that may be harmful to your kidneys.

You should weigh yourself every day and call your PCP if your 
weight goes up by more than 3 lbs, as this could indicate that 
you are having more fluid build-up.

Unfortunately, during your stay you were exposed to someone with 
the flu. We offered you medicine to prevent you from also 
getting the flu and monitored you for signs of illness.

We have scheduled follow up appointments with cardiology and 
your primary care provider (detailed below). You should review 
your discharge medication list because it details the changes we 
made to your home medications. We are giving you a prescription 
to have your INR and electrolytes (including kidney function 
tests) checked on ___.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

History of Present Illness:
___ yo with h/o CAD s/p DES, CKD, CHF on torsemide, AF on 
coumadin, p/w worsening pedal edema and ""rales in my lungs"". Pt 
states she has had 4 small heart attacks and they started with 
these symptoms. The pt states she has been in Afib for 2 weeks. 
She saw her cardiologist recently and because of afib with rate 
of 125bpm in the office her carvedilol was increased from 25 BID 
to ___ Q8H and digoxin was added. Yesterday morning the 
patient noted ankle edema. She took an extra tablet of torsemide 
(total of 80mg) without improvement in her symptoms. She 
presented to the ED out of concern that this was an MI. She 
denies cough or shortness of breath. She denies orthopnea or 
PND. She chronically wakes every 2 hours to urinate and has not 
noticed a change to that pattern. She does not weight herself at 
home. She tries to be careful with salt intake but occasionally 
cheats with bites of pizza or soups. She denies any chest pain. 
No N/V/D, no F/C.  

Of note, pt was admitted in late ___ for Afib with RVR and 
mild CHF exacerbation. She was diuresed with IV lasix and 
metolazone. Dry weight on discharge: 103 kg. Discharged on 
torsemide 40mg daily, which was uptitrated by her cardiologist 
to 60mg BID as an outpatient. She also had RVR which was felt to 
be trigged by CHF exacerbation. Beta blocker was changed from 
carvedilol to metop succinate and diltiazem was added. The 
patient had a rash with those medications so she was switched 
back to carvedilol shortly after discharge. As noted above, 
digoxin was recently added for Afib with RVR in outpatient 
setting.  
 
She had a recent gout flare treated with prednisone taper. Taper 
ended about 10 days ago.  

In the ED intial vitals were: 0 98.1 87 160/62 15 92%  
 
EKG: NSR, rate 86, normal intervals, normal axis, TWF aVL, TWI

was in ___, CXR unremarkable, U/A 9 WBC/3 epis/no 
bacteria/neg nitr.  
Patient was given: 40 IV lasix and ASA to equal 325mg for the 
day  
Vitals on transfer: 0 86 123/89 19 97% RA  

On the floor patient reports improved breathing with nasal

Studies:

___ Cardiovascular ECHO   
   Conclusions  
The patient exercised for 2 minutes and 30 seconds according to 
a Gervino treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart 
rate of 99 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 190/70 mmHg. The 
test was stopped because of fatigue and the patient's request. 
This level of exercise represents a very poor exercise tolerance 
for age. In response to stress, the ECG showed no ST-T wave 
changes (see exercise report for details). There is resting 
systolic hypertension. The blood pressure response to exercise 
was normal normal. There was a blunted heart rate response to 
stress [beta blockade]. 
   Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 76 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 160/70 mmHg. These demonstrated normal 
regional and global left ventricular systolic function. E/e' 
suggests increased PCWP. Right ventricular free wall motion is 
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler demonstrated 
mild-moderate mitral regurgitation with no aortic stenosis, 
aortic regurgitation or significant resting LVOT gradient. There 
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
Echo images were acquired within 48 seconds after peak stress at 
heart rates of 93 - 82 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate 
augmentation of all left ventricular segments. E/e was 20 at 78 
seconds after exercise and was similar to baseline, suggesting 
no abnormal increase in left ventricular filling pressure during 
exercise There was augmentation of right ventricular free wall 
motion. 
   IMPRESSION: Very poor functional exercise capacity. No ECG or 
2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved 
very low workload. No change in diastolic LV parameters with 
exercise. Resting hypertension with blunted heart rate response 
to physiologic stress. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation at 
rest. Severe PA systolic hypertension at rest.   

___ Cardiovascular STRESS   
IMPRESSION: Very poor exercise capacity in the absence of 
symptoms. No 
ischemic ST segment changes to achieved very low level of work. 
Resting 
systolic hypertension with low normal blood pressure and blunted 
heart 
rate response to exercise. Echo report sent separately. 

___ Cardiovascular ECG  
Sinus rhythm. Slight ST segment depression in leads V4-V6. 
Consider ischemia. ST segment depression is new compared to the 
previous tracing. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PA & LAT) 
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of CAD s/p mid-RCA DES ___, paroxysmal afib on 
coumadin, heart failure with preserved EF, and TDM2 presenting 
with ankle edema, found to have mildly elevated troponin, 
admitted for r/o ACS (negative) and diuresis. Her bilat ___ edema 
is thought to have a significant component of CVI. She is also 
having difficult interactions with healthcare providers.

ACTIVE PROBLEM LIST
diastolic CHF, acute on chronic
pedal edema
HTN
possible ACS
atrial fibrillation
abusive behavior towards staff

# dCHF, acute on chronic: Pt presented mildly vol up on exam, 
weight 107 kg up from dry weight of 103kg. She also had mild 
pedal edema. Echo with PAH as above; in the past, per Atrius 
attg, she's had this on inpatient echos during CHF exacerbations 
that improved on outpatient echos, suggesting high filling 
pressures in stg of volume overload.
- monitoring: tele, daily weight, I/O, BID lytes
- diuresis: treated with furosemide IV 120 BID + metolazone 5 
with neg 1.5-2L diuresis. Transitioned from IV to home torsemide 
prior to discharge. Dry weight ***  
- home meds: cont BBL, dig. dig level therapeutic this 
admission. 
- reassess TTE as outpatient

# HTN: Patient registering occasional SBPs in 180s. Viewing her 
VS with O2 desaturation and HTN, and considering her body 
habitus, suspect she may have OSA. When we've proposed this 
before, she adamantly denies that she has this diagnosis; she 
has never had PSG.
- continue home irbesartan
- cont carvedilol 25 TID
- consider adding an additional antihypertensive
- diuresis as above
- transitional: outpatient PSG to eval for OSA

# Pedal edema: Mild CHF exacerbation + CVI. Diuresis as above. 
CTM. likely needs compression stockings for LEs but refusing. 

# ACS Rule out / CAD: ECG/biomarkers neg for ASA. Stress test 
without ischemia as above. For CAD, cont ASA, BBL, ___. Patient 
refuses statin ___ myalgias with atorva/simva/prava.  

# Atrial fibrillation: Currently NSR after recent increase in 
carvedilol as well as addition of digoxin by her cardiologist. 
Afib may have been triggered by recent prednisone treatment for 
gout. INR subtherapeutic at 1.8. Received her higher dose 
warfarin today per usual schedule.  
-cont warfarin at home dose, daily INR
-cont carvedilol and digoxin  
-dig level therapeutic 

# Abusive behavior towards staff: Patient demanding 
interventions from healthcare personnel (further details below), 
using expletives and insults with treating physicians. Patient 
Relations consulted - patient indicated she had no problems with 
health care staff and that she'd had a ""wonderful experience,"" 
per Relations staff. To best meet her needs, we limited 
interactions with the patient. Team rounds to prevent ambiguity 
of plan. We suspect she has borderline personality disorder 
superimposed on her other psychiatric illness. For extended 
documentation of the challenges she posed and our thoughts, 
please see ""Other Addenda"" below.

CHRONIC
# T2DM: cont home lantus 20u QHS; HISS  
# CKD III: Baseline cr 1.6, likely DM and HTN. Cr 1.8 on 
admission. Has gone up to 2.7 during prior admissions for 
diuresis.  
# HLD: continue home dose Ezetimibe  
# Gout: Recently finished prednisone taper. continue Febuxostat  

# Psych: Continue BuPROPion (Sustained Release) 150 mg PO QAM  

TRANSITIONAL
- Med changes: increased carvedilol from ___ -> ___

- HTN: patient with elevated BPs in house. may need uptitration 
of antihypertensives. likely also needs sleep study for OSA.

- OSA: patient spiking SBPs to 180s-190s overnight in setting of 
SaO2 desaturations to high ___. she is obese by BMI 
criteria. when we queried her re: OSA/sleep study, she indicated 
she lives alone and no one could report on snoring history. 
denies daytime somnolence. adamantly asserts that she does not 
have this dx and refuses even consideration of sleep study. 
likely should be readdressed as an outpatient. 

- T2DM: patient with elevated FSG in house but refusing our 
sliding scale. at first, we offered her more and she refused it. 
then, she wanted more than we were giving her. we had lengthy 
discussions with her - she wanted us to just administer her 
exactly the number she indicated depending on her sugar, which 
we told her we could not do for her safety. we checked A1c 
(8.6%), and tried to counsel her that we could help get sugars 
under better control, but she adamantly refused. perhaps she'll 
be more interested in the outpatient setting, but she's at high 
risk of ASCVD and worsening renal failure as a result of her 
adamant refusal to change her insulin use habits. 

OTHER ADDENDA
Documentation of patient's abusive behavior towards staff:

1. Excerpt from ___ attending's note:

""Patient seen and examined along with Dr. ___, on
bedside rounds.  
No events on tele o/n. Labs showing ongoing elevation of BUN,
stable Cr 1.9, HCO3 stable @ 28, K 4.6. Troponin remained flat @
___ yesterday, negative MB.  
Bedside rounds were very challenging - Ms. ___ appeared to be
very upset, asking why she was not getting her home torsemide
dose and why she had not yet received any diuretics this 
morning.
We advised her that in order for the medical team to make a
decision re: diuretic management, we need to see/examine her,
look at her objective data (labs, urine output, etc.) to
determine what was the appropriate next step...""

""During the bedside rounding, as well as discussion, Ms. ___
became increasingly ___ and belligerent.  

""When asked about her leg tenderness to palpation, she repeated
that it was tender if her legs were pressed too hard. When asked
if this was a chronic issue, she responded ""why don't you tell
me.""  

""When we were discussing her UOP and response to diuretics. She
stated that she was upset that she had not gotten her morning
torsemide and that no one had been by to discuss with her. She
had received a dose of IV lasix late last night, and we 
discussed
that oral diuretics, when not effective at home, are replaced
with iv diuretics, as previously explained by the ___ team upon
admission. We explained that she had not received any further
diuretics as of yet, as we need to determine her clinical
response to the medications.""

""When asked about her urination response, she stated that she
would to the bathroom, and self-record the amt of urine in the
collecting hat, and then flush it down the drain. We advised her
that our preference would be that the RNs formally measure and
record the UOP and to not have her discard it. She became quite
upset, saying that it ""was a waste of professional time, as I
have a college degree and can read numbers."" We advised that our
customary hospital practice is to have the RN staff formally
measure and record UOP, as this is their area of expertise, to
ensure accurate measurements, and thus appropriate medical Rx.
She stated that she would not comply with this request, stating
that we were ""stupid"" and when asked why she was against this,
stated that ""it is disgusting"" to have urine remain in the hat.
We also advised that RN staff could promptly come to measure and
dispose of the urine, to which she objected ___ she felt RN 
staff
was too slow and that this was all 'ridiculous.' 
 
""Discussed that we were trying to do our best to take care of 
her
from a medical standpoint, and our discussion above was to try 
to
be as accurate and thorough as possible. However, with ongoing
attempt to discuss the above, she indicated that she no longer
wanted to continue the discussion, and then called Dr. ___ ""a
son of a bitch"" and stated that she did not trust either of us.  


""Discussed also with the RN staff and team to also contact
patient relations.""

2. Other behaviors

- The first night of her hospitalization, I walked into her room
and she demanded, ""Where's my home torsemide!?"" We tried to
explain that, during IV diuresis, we hold home medications and
that we were actually giving her double her home dose. She
replied, ""Well you clearly haven't fixed the problem, have you?!
You have no idea what you're doing."" and indicated her feet,
which were still notable for 1+ edema.  

- On a daily basis, referred to me as ""stupid,"" ""incompetent,"" 
or
""untrustworthy""; multiple RNs interacting with her had the same
experience.

- Would angrily utter expletives during bedside rounds. For
example, when the attending asked her to sit forward in bed so 
we
could auscultate her lungs, she shouted, ""Well, fuck!""

- Refused even a basic discussion of her medications. To take 
one
example, given our difficulties with insulin use and her desire
to have control over insulin administration, I printed the
insulin sliding scale we had ordered for her, provided a writing
implement, and asked her for feedback on how we could order it
differently. She wrote several changes down (most of which
involved not giving any more than 12 units under any
circumstances, for any fingerstick, despite obvious need for 
more
insulin). On multiple occasions, she insisted that she be 
allowed
to self-administer insulin or specify the exact dose she should
receive. 
   I explained that we were medically and legally responsible 
for
adequate control of her sugars in the hospital, and that we
likely could not provide whatever dose she wanted based on the
mood of the moment. I also reiterated that we were willing to
negotiate and adjust her insulin dosing with her. She then
shouted, ""I know my body! You don't! You clearly don't have any
idea what you're doing and you're not going to help me! Get the
hell out of my room!""
   I returned to try again at a later time; her family member 
was
at bedside. She said, ""I'm spending time with my family and
refuse to talk to you. Get the hell out.""

3. Thoughts on her behavior: 

She unfortunately displayed hostile and aggressive behavior with
the medical, nursing, and patient care staff on a continuous
basis. We believe this compromises her ability to receive the
best care, as it makes her very resistant to even relatively
innocuous or small recommendations. However, this should not
dissuade health care providers from treating her with respect 
and
from re-addressing her multiple ongoing health concerns. If her
medical problems above remain untreated, she is at high risk of
early morbidity and mortality, and the suffering those will
bring. If she returns to our hospital for ongoing care, we will
do our best to address her problems, negotiate treatments with
her to the best of our ability to do so safely, and treat her
with the respect and dignity due all our patients.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were treated at ___ for a very mild exacerbation of your 
heart failure. We gave you IV diuretics (water pills) to take 
off extra fluid, and then re-started your home medications. 

During your admission, we noticed several other problems that 
you may wish to address with your primary care doctor:

- Hypertension: Your blood pressure was persistently high. You 
may need more blood pressure medication. 

- Sleep Apnea: You also developed some very high blood pressures 
overnight in the setting of low oxygen levels, which suggests a 
diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. You should talk to your 
primary care physician about ___ sleep study. 

- Diabetes: Unfortunately, we had some difficulties keeping your 
sugars under control in the hospital. Your measure of long-term 
control, the A1c, is very high (around 9%, where the goal is < 
7% and normal is less than 5.4%). This suggests that you need 
more insulin at regular times of day (before breakfast, lunch, 
dinner, and at bedtime). Your doses of ___ units may not be 
enough, and because your sugars are high, it is safe to give you 
more as long as we increase the amount slowly. We're concerned 
because uncontrolled diabetes can cause heart disease, kidney 
problems, and strokes, and with some modifications to your 
regimen, we think your diabetes can be better controlled and 
your risk of these conditions developing will be lower.

Please see your appointments and medications below.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Cardiology Team

MICROBIOLOGY
============
Blood cultures - negative
Urine culture - negative
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with a h/o CAD, diastolic CHF, AFib, DM, CKD 4, Gout, 
who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure most consistent 
with a COPD exacerbation, and ___ on CKD.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
===============
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
# COPD Exacerbation
# Aspiration PNA
Her presenting symptoms included a preceding URI, which led to 
wheezing, cough, and dyspnea, in a patient with longstanding 
smoking history.  She had a low peak flow. Thus, her diagnosis 
was most consistent with a COPD exacerbation, although there was 
no diagnosis of COPD prior to admission.  She remained hypoxic 
when ambulatory on room air throughout her admission despite 
several days of high dose PO steroid (Methylpred 32mg daily - 
this chosen as opposed to Prednisone for simplicity's sake as 
she is chronically on low dose Methylpred), and scheduled/PRN 
nebulizers.  Thus, due to continued hypoxia, repeat CXR was done 
on ___, which showed only radiographic evidence of COPD, as 
well as atelectasis.  She was thus given Incentive Spirometry 
for atelectasis.  As she remained hypoxic, CT chest was then 
done ___, showing likely consolidation due to aspiration in 
both lower lobes.  She was thus started on Augmentin, and will 
complete ___s outpatient.  There was no evidence of 
CHF exacerbation based on bedside eval or imaging. PE unlikely 
given she is chronically on Warfarin.  Home O2 was arranged, but 
the patient declined this on day of discharge.  Started inhaled 
fluticasone BID given clinical certainty of COPD. Outpatient 
PFT's recommended on discharge.

# ___ on Stage 4 CKD: Presented with Cr 3.5, but quickly 
downtrended back to baseline mid-2's without any intervention. 
She appeared euvolemic, although volume status is certainly 
complex given CHF history. It is unclear what the acute insult 
was to cause worsening Cr of admission. FE-Urea was 28%, which 
is consistent with pre-renal azotemia, but not a fully reliable 
test. Renal US was unremarkable.  Her home Torsemide was 
continued.  Her home ___ (irbesartan) was replaced with Losartan 
while in house, as irbesartan is not formulary.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
================
# Chronic Diastolic CHF: No e/o exacerbation. She is below prior 
dry weight and had minimal edema and no significant rales.  
Continued home Torsemide, Carvedilol. Continued ___.  Monitored 
volume status. Low salt diet

# CAD: Stable.
- Continue home ASA 81mg, Ezetimibe, Carvedilol
- ___ as above

# A-Fib on Warfarin: INR was supratherapeutic on admission, held 
Warfarin, and resumed once INR was therapeutic.  There were no 
further INR issues.
- Continued Warfarin
- Daily INR, should recheck as outpatient with ___ Anticoag 
Team per their routine
- Continue home digoxin (level checked, was 0.9)

# Diabetes
- Continue home Glargine/Humalog regimen, along with sliding 
scale

# Gout
- Continue home Febuxostat
- Continue home Methylprednisolone 4mg (initially was on higher 
dose of 32mg daily to treat COPD exacerbation)

# Hypothyroidism
- Continue home Levothyroxine 

# Anxiety
- Continue home Bupropion, Lorazepam

# Incidental findings
- Pulm nodules need f/u CT in 6 weeks
- Adrenal nodule needs f/u CT or MRI with adrenal protocol as 
outpatient

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
- Augmentin 500mg BID x7 days for aspiration pneumonia, ___
- Started inhaled fluticasone BID given likely COPD
- Arranged for home O2 and offered to the patient, but she 
declined it
- Outpatient PFT's recommended
- Needs f/u CT chest in 6 weeks to assess for resolution of x2 
10mm pulmonary nodules seen on CT chest
- Adrenal nodule noted on CT chest. Needs outpatient adrenal 
protocol CT or MRI for further characterization of left adrenal 
nodule

kidney. 

Medications that likely contributed to this injury are torsemide 
and irbesartan. It will be important to wait before restarting 
either of these medications, to allow your kidneys to continue 
to heal. Please continue to take your other medications as 
listed below. Please follow up with the appointment listed 
below, at which point your doctor ___ determine what dose of 
torsemide to re-start. If you notice new or worsening symptoms, 
please seek medical care.

It has been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we wish you 
the best.

underwent a left femoral to above knee popliteal bypass with 
NRGSV and left foot ulcer debridement with wound vac
placement. She was seen in clinic 3 days ago with left leg 
incision healing slowly and evidence of skin separation and 
wound infection in the left thigh.  There was weeping fluid but 
not purulent and staples intact. There also was significant 
surrounding erythema and so she was sent to rehab with augmentin
and was to follow-up in clinic in 2 weeks. She presents to the 
ED today with worsening pain and L groin to medial though wound 
dehiscence and purulent drainage. She is otherwise feeling well 
without fevers or chills, nausea or vomiting. She was admitted

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presented on ___ to the emergency room with a 
concern for a surgical site infection and was given 
vanc/cipro/flagyl immediately. Her INR was also noted to be 5, 
so she received 10 of vitamin K in the emergency room. Her 
repeat INR was 2.3 preop. She was then taken to the operating 
room in the morning of ___ for a debridement and washout of 
the LLE. Please see OP note for more details regarding the 
procedure. Postoperatively, the LLE continued to exsanguinate. 
Cauterization and compression was done in the PACU and she was 
transferred to the wards. On ___ evening, she was noted to 
be hypotensive to SBP ___ and her Hct had drifted from 27 to 21. 
She was transferred to the SICU for monitoring. She received 2 
units of pRBC and 1 unit of FFP along with 10 of vitamin K. Her 
INR was noted to be 1.7 with Hct stable at 28. Since her last 
echo was only done in ___, a repeat echo was done that revealed 
her EF to be 40%, and so she was carefully volume resuscitated 
in preparation for another debridement, washout and vac 
placement on ___. Please see op report for more details. 
Following her ___ postop course, her summary will be written by 
systems. 

#NEURO: Patient was kept intubated and sedated to help 
facilitate multiple evaluation of her wound, however she was 
extubated on HD4 due to hypotension. Her pain was controlled 
with oxycodone and dilaudid. 

#CV: Patient was noted to become transiently hypotensive to SBP 
___ while she was sedated and so required levo on HD4. Her 
pressures improved once she was extubated. The patient remained 
stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were 
routinely monitored.

#PULMONARY: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. She was 
extubated on HD4 without issues. 

#GI/GU/FEN: The patient had a foley placed intra-operatively for 
volume monitoring as well as to keep her incision clean. She was 
restarted on her home torsemide on ___. The patient was 
given oral diet once extubated, which she tolerated well. She 
was noted to have loose bowel movements and incontinent. Her 
C.diff was negative and so was given a flexiseal on HD3 to keep 
her wound clean. 

#ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs 
of infection. She was kept on vanc/cipro/flagyl as her initial 
wound cultures from her initial washout was noted to be 4+GNR, 
2+ GPC in pairs and chains and 1+ GPRs. On HD4, her cultures 
showed enterococcus and acinetobacter that were resistant to 
cipro and so was transitioned to ___ on HD4. ID was 
consulted on HD5. Given that there were no cultures showing MRSA 
and her vanc trough continued to be high, they recommended 
holding off on vanc. Her VAC was changed q3d and on her second 
VAC change, tissue swabs and cultures were sent that showed GPC 
in chains and pairs and GNRs. Updated culture data suggested VRE 
and daptomycin was started per ID recs. At the time of her 
discharge, antibiotics were discontinued according to the 
patient and her daughter's wishes (see below). 

#HEME: Patient received several units of blood over her hospital 
course for low hematocrits related to bleeding from her left 
thigh wound. Her last transfusion was ___ and her hematocrits 
were stable the following two days. 

#WOUNDS: The patient's left thigh wound vac was changed every 
___ days. She was also found to have bilateral lower extremity 
pressure ulcers, more extensive on the left than the right leg. 
The ulcers on the left leg were found to have purulent 
discharge, so she was taken to the operating room again on HD9 
(___) for debridement of her left lower extremity pressure 
ulcers. Santyl was used on these ulcers for the first 3 days 
post operatively. At the time of discharge to hospice, the wound 
vac was removed and the thigh wound was redressed with wet to 
dry gauze and overlying curlex. 

On ___ a family meeting was held with the patient's daughter 
and healthcare proxy with a discussion about the lack of 
progression in her wounds. The following day a second meeting 
was held with the patient's daughter as well as representatives 
from palliative care, social work, case management, and vascular 
surgery. At that time the patient and her daughter elected to 
transfer the patient to a ___ facility and enact a DNR/DNI 
order. At the time of her discharge, the patient's vitals were 
stable.
